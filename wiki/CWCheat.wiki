===Debug code===
{{{
_C0 World Map Debug
_L 0xD02A528C 0x20000000
_L 0x002A528C 0x00000006
}}}
This is the same as the debug code for the Playstation version. The battle selector doesn't seem to work right, though: whenever the battle starts it always tells me Game Over and I get sent back to the map.
