Some people were having trouble with the readme and instructions I provided, so I'll try to explain the process in more detail here.

== Summary ==
Save games on the PSP memory stick are *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption encrypted]*. It is currently not possible to decrypt the saves with anything other than a PSP. FFTSaveHook.prx is a *kernel plugin* that decrypts and reencrypts FFT: War of the Lions saves automatically.

== Kernel plugin requirements ==
  * PSP or PSP Slim Lite
  * Custom Firmware 3.71 M33 or higher (The process of installing custom firmware is beyond the scope of this document. Check out [http://maxconsole.com MaxConsole] and [http://pspupdates.qj.net PSPUpdates])

== Kernel plugin installation and use ==
  # Plug your Memory Stick into your computer or hook up a USB cable between your PSP and computer
  # Run the LionEditor.exe program
  # Click the "Install plugin to Memory Stick" button at the top right of the window.
  # Select the drive letter of your PSP or Memory Stick
  # Put your memory stick back in your PSP
  # Boot the PSP into the custom firmware's *Recovery Mode* by holding *the R Button* as you turn on the PSP
  # Select _Plugins_
  # Highlight `FFTSaveHook.prx [GAME]` and push *the X Button*.
  # Ensure that it now says `FFTSaveHook.prx [GAME] (Enabled)`
  # Exit the recovery menu
  # Put your Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions UMD in your PSP
  # Start the game
  # Load your saved game
    * When this is done a new file is created on your Memory Stick `ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/ULUS10297FFT0000/lioneditor.bin` (For the US version)
  # Turn off your PSP and hook it up to the computer again
