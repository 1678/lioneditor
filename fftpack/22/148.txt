[Dialog]-The- Baert Trading Company?{END}

Ah, then you've heard of them. But they're no
ordinary traders.

That business is only a front for more...lucrative
pursuits. Opium smuggling, slave trading-all
manner of vile thing, on a grand scale.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]What did you do to draw the attention of
such as these?{END}

I'm a machinist. Do you know the history of
my trade?{END}

They say the ruins of a lost civilization lie
buried beneath the streets of Goug, the
Clockwork City.
Relics from the age of Saint Ajora, when
airships numerous beyond counting filled the 
skies, and men of iron walked city streets.
But the art of crafting such things was
lost-if it ever truly existed at all.{END}

But it -did- exist.


The ground beneath Goug holds the hulks of
airships, and a thousand fragments of machines
the gods alone know the workings of.
A machinist toils to restore this lost legacy-
to see these works brought to life again.{END}

The device you used during the battle-is
that one of these machines?{END}

What, this?


This is a weapon called a "pistol." It uses an
explosive powder to propel a metal projectile
toward its target.
This one is of simple make. There were once
pistols said to fire projectiles infused with
magicks.{END}

Hmm.{END}

So why do these hounds of the Baert
Trading Company chase after you?{END}

You said you were going to see Cardinal
Delacroix, yes?

The cardinal is a hero who fought in the
Fifty Years' War. To this day the people
of Lionel honor him as such.
As does my father. He believes that the
cardinal is the only man who can keep the
realm from descending into chaos.
The cardinal will receive you, hear your
plea. And the princess will be safe.{END}

And what is it -you- want?{END}

To go with you. I have my own reason for
wanting to speak with the cardinal.{END}

That being?{END}

To save my father!


He is held prisoner. The cardinal is my
only hope to free him!

Alone, I am just another machinist-the
cardinal would never see me. That's why
I would join you.{END}

You still haven't answered my question.
Why is the Baert Trading Company so
interested in you?{END}

I...I cannot tell you. Not now.{END}

Then you remain here.{END}

No! I must see the cardinal!
You must trust me, please!{END}

[Portrait]Ovelia
[Dialog]Very well, then. You will come with us.{END}

You mean it? Thank you, my lady.
Thank you!{END}

You stand before the princess!{END}

There is no need. You may rise.{END}

Then it's settled. We will trust to your word.{END}
