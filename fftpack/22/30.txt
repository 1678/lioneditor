[Dialog]My own house was once respected as
highly as House Beoulve, you know.{END}

At least, until my grandfather was captured
during the war.

He turned traitor, thinking to buy his freedom
with the lives of his friends.

But his freedom scarce outlived his honor.
He was not a dozen paces out their gate
when the dagger found his back.
Killed by some common squire, no more a
knight than I.

One of the men he betrayed later escaped
and spread word of his misdeeds.

My lord father would have none of it, of course.
But he was the only one. Our bannermen
deserted us, our reputation ruined.{END}

I suppose I had best remember my place.
Your lord brother has no reason to lend
ear to pleas from the likes of me.{END}

[Dialog]Alma! Zalbaag!{END}

[Portrait]Alma Beoulve
[Dialog]<Ramza>, you've come home!{END}

It's been some time,
hasn't it, Zalbaag?{END}

[Portrait]Zalbaag
[Dialog]I heard about Gariland. They say you
made short work of those brigands.
Now you've truly the right to call yourself
a Beoulve. Father would be proud.{END}

Thank you, Lord Brother.{END}

Ha! You certainly haven't changed. Gods
forbid you show a bit of cheer on being
praised!
And you, Delita! Do not think word of your
deeds escapes our ears. Your sister's been
so full of pride I quite feared she might burst!{END}

[Portrait]Tietra
[Dialog]Worry not, my seams have held. I'm
glad to see you looking so well, Delita.{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]And I you. Have you
settled in at school?{END}

Yes, the others have all been quite
kind to me.{END}

Would that we could speak at greater leisure,
but there are duties that require my attendance.
Rogues do not catch themselves.{END}

I understand.
Good luck.{END}

We received a note of ransom
from the Corpse Brigade.{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]What!?{END}

Something about it sits unwell with
me.

They are anarchists to be sure, bent
on bringing down the aristocracy.

But they fancy themselves righteous,
and prey only on the nobility and
those in our employ.
Would such as they truly kidnap the
marquis for want of coin?{END}

Why wouldn't they? They're
naught but common footpads!{END}

One of the men I planted among them has
not returned.

I worry he may be caught up in something
serious, but there are those who do not think
some mere spy worth a search party's efforts.{END}

Where was he last known to be?{END}

A merchant city named Dorter in eastern
Gallionne.

Guarding a castle grows dreadfully dull.
...Wouldn't you agree?{END}

Forgive us, Tietra. It seems we must be
leaving sooner than we had planned.{END}

Don't worry about me-just take
care of yourself.{END}

I will. Mind your studies! I'll be back
before you've even noticed I'm gone.{END}

Let's be on our way.{END}

[Portrait]Alma
[Dialog]Tietra puts on a brave face, but the
truth is not as honeyed as her words.{END}

What do you mean?{END}

She has a hard time of it at school.
The others tease her for being lowborn.{END}

...{END}

Forgive me, I shouldn't have said anything.
I'm sure you have worries enough of your
own.
Tietra will be all right. I'm here to look after
her.{END}

Then there is naught to worry about.
But mind your own limits. You can't
be responsible for everything.{END}

Says the brother who never fails to do any
and all that is expected of him.

Don't lose sight of yourself,
<Ramza>.

You needn't let your life be ruled by the
fact you were born a Beoulve.{END}

Now you're starting to sound like Mother.
Ha ha ha!{END}

<Ramza>...{END}
