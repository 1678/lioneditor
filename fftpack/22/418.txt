[Portrait]Master Darlavon
[Dialog]Now then, let us begin the lesson.

In this session, we will discuss the CT gauge
and how it relates to the order in which units
take their turns.
All units, be they enemy or ally, move and
act in a certain order.

The order in which units take their turns is
determined by their charge time (CT).

Once a unit's CT gauge fills up, that unit's
turn has arrived.

You may check a unit's charge time by looking
at his or her CT gauge.

The CT gauge is located below the unit's
HP and MP.{END}

This gauge, located at the bottom of a unit's
status display in the lower left corner of the
screen, represents his or her charge time.
Once this gauge reaches 100, it is fully
charged and it becomes the unit's turn to
move and act.
The CT gauges of all units fill with each tick
of the game clock, but the rate at which
they fill is different for each unit.
Because of this, some units will see their
turns come more quickly than others.

Allow me to explain a bit more about how the
CT gauge fills.{END}

Here is the unit's status screen.


Look at the left side of the middle panel.
You will see an attribute labeled Speed.{END}

Allow me to give an example.{END}

This unit has a Speed of 9.{END}

This unit has a Speed of 6.{END}

Let us observe how their CT gauges fill.{END}

sees his turn come earlier.

Of course, in an actual battle, you do not
have to wait while the CT gauges fill up.

The active turn will automatically advance
to whichever unit has the next turn.

Now you know how the CT gauge works.


A unit's Speed is added to the gauge for
each tick of the game clock, until the gauge
reaches 100. Then it is the unit's turn.
Thus, the higher a unit's Speed, the more
often he or she will receive a turn.{END}

Even understanding how the CT gauge
controls turn order, it is difficult to keep
track of the turn order for all units.
So, I shall teach you a simple method of
checking the turn order in battle.{END}

Look at the status display at the bottom of the
screen. There are two numbers to the upper right
of the unit's portrait.
The number to the left of the slash indicates
that unit's turn order. The number to the right
is the total number of units on the battlefield.
Thus, to see an estimate of when a unit will get
his or her turn, you merely have to move the
cursor to the unit's tile and check this number.
I say "estimate," because in some cases the
CT gauge will be filled in an irregular fashion.

In particular, I am referring to what happens
when a unit chooses the Wait command.{END}

A unit can use the Wait command when he
or she only wants to move or act, or does
not wish to do anything.
Normally, when a unit's turn ends, the CT
gauge resets to zero.

But when a unit ends his or her turn by
selecting "Wait," the gauge will start its
next count from 20 or even 40.
When a unit selects the command after
moving or acting, the gauge will be reset
to 20.
When a unit chooses to wait without
moving or acting at all, the gauge will
be reset to 40.
In other words, the time until the unit's next
turn will be shortened.

This may sometimes change the turn order
of the units on the battlefield.

If you plan carefully, you can use the
Wait command to your advantage.{END}

This concludes my explanation of the CT
gauge and turn order.

Let us review.


A unit's turn comes when his or her CT gauge
reaches 100.

With every tick of the game clock, a unit's
CT gauge increases by an amount equal to
the unit's Speed attribute.
Thus, the higher a unit's Speed, the more
often he or she will receive a turn.

Understanding these concepts should allow you
to gain the upper hand in any battle.

With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.{END}

Every time the CT gauge is incremented, the
value increases by an amount equal to the
unit's Speed.
This means that units with a high Speed will
see their CT gauges fill more quickly.{END}
