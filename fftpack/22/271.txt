[Portrait]Rapha
[Dialog]Grand Duke Barrington has eyes for one thing:
the throne of Ivalice.
They call him King already-King of the Forge.
He fashions ever more and stronger arms, and
trains mages enough for all the realm.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]His actions are guided from the shadows.

There are others-men who promise to
eliminate the dukes Larg and Goltanna,
and dub the grand duke regent.{END}

And you fight these men, when fighting them
means you must be labeled a heretic? Why
would you do such a thing?
No, that is a silly question. I know the answer.
But surely you must realize your efforts will
earn you no thanks.{END}

I do not fight for gratitude.


I am a Beoulve. I fight for the honor
of my name.{END}

I'd not believe that for a moment. You strike
me not as the sort of man to fight for things
so trite.
No, you see evil and injustice before your
eyes and cannot turn away. You do not even
think to seek reward.{END}

You mistake me for a better man.


But we have spoken enough of me.
What will you do now? I must make for 
Riovanes. They hold my sister there.
What of you, now that you've escaped? {END}

I cannot leave. Not without my brother.{END}

There's a quarrel between the two of
you, is there not?{END}

He refuses to accept the truth. We were
orphaned in the war, you see. We lost our
parents, our home-all but our lives.
The memories haunt me even now. Climbing
mounds of rubble in search of any scrap of food,
the air ever thick with death's foul stench...
That was the life from which the grand duke
spared us. At the time, I thought it sure the
gods had sent him.{END}

You were not alone. He erected a great many
orphanages in the war's wake. It was a noble
gesture of less than noble intent.
He wanted assassins. The orphanages gave him
a pool of willing young minds, allowing him to
select the very best to groom and train.
He must have seen some promise in you and
your brother.{END}

We Galthenas are the keepers of a sacred
art, passed down through the generations.

My brother and I are conduits, I of the
heavens and he of the nether. We channel
their power through mantra.
Grand Duke Barrington desired that power
for his own. When our elder refused him, the
grand duke put our entire village to the torch.
All is grist that comes to that man's mill.
If there is a thing he cannot have, he thinks
it better that it not exist at all.
To imagine the joy he must have felt when
he discovered the two of us among the other
orphans-it turns my stomach.{END}

So when you learned of all this, you tried
to flee...{END}

My brother and I loved the man as
though he were our father.

But even that did not stop him
from...from-!{END}

For a man of his high station to so
prey upon the weak-it is not meet.{END}

[Portrait]Marach's Voice
[Dialog]I would have thought you fled
farther.{END}

Marach!{END}

Heed my words, heretic! Spare
no haste on your way to Riovanes!

Tarry here, and you next meet your
sister in the afterlife!{END}

Harm a hair on her head, and
I'll have you there for company!{END}

Rapha! You will accompany
<Ramza>.

Run, and the death of his sister
hangs on your shoulders.{END}

You play a craven game, Marach!
This has naught to do with them!{END}

I play no -game-! I trust you know
what awaits should you try my
patience any longer!{END}

Come, <Ramza>. Let us make
for Riovanes.{END}

Forgive me. I did not mean to draw
you into this.{END}

You didn't. This madness is none of
your doing.{END}
