[Portrait]Cardinal Delacroix
[Dialog]I see Gaffgarion's sword was no match for
his words.
Then again, perhaps the fault lies with his
adversary. Beoulve blood is not given to
spill easily.
Even when thinned with that of a courtesan,
it would seem.{END}

But enough is enough. Your intrusions overstay
their welcome.

Leave the auracite, and then leave Lionel.
A generous offer, and my last.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Where is Lady Ovelia?{END}

You mean to free her? What then?


You've turned your back on your house.
A man cannot prosecute a war alone.

Forget this bootless struggle. Think you
mere -will- enough to see you victorious?

Even will needs force, and you have none.{END}

Tell me where the princess is!{END}

Gone to Zeltennia.


Her Highness has chosen to accept our hand
in aid over yours.{END}

You lie!{END}

Her Highness has taken her first step toward
the throne.

But she will need a steady hand to guide her,
and yours falters. Who better, then, than us
to stand at her side?
She saw this-why not you? There's no reason
you should not join us as well. The thought of
besting your brothers holds no allure?
We care no less for this world's fate than you.
Together we can change Ivalice for the better.{END}

I have no wish to change the world. But
nor can I stand by while men suffer and
die on the whim of some select few.
Do you truly believe you can change the
world? Not even I am so naive as that.{END}

Ha ha! Nescient humility from one possessed
of such an artefact.

That Stone you hold can twist the very
weave of nature, to say nothing of the
world.
Yet I fear my words are wasted on you.
Actions speak louder, yes?{END}

[Portrait]Cúchulainn, the Impure
[Dialog]You take no pains to hide your wonderment.

How I shall delight to watch you die.
Each excruciation ecstasy!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]This is auracite's sacred power?

How can power so vile banish villainy?


Surely the cardinal was no greater evil
than this!{END}

[Portrait]Cúchulainn, the Impure
[Dialog]Behold Lucavi pow'r made manifest!
Whose might o'er all Creation once held sway.{END}

The power of the Lucavi?


I see only a devil before me! What have you
done with the cardinal?{END}

What nonsense this? I am the man himself!


Or rather he who once was Delacroix!


The Stone, the auracite, such pow'rs grant,
to rise above Man's frailty-a god.

A god who brooks no meddling of fools!
Die, and know suff'ring!{END}

[Portrait]Cúchulainn, the Impure
[Dialog]How strange that I, Undying,
here should die.
A death come early, ere my
master could return...{END}
