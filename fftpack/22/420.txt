[Portrait]Master Darlavon
[Dialog]Now then, let us begin the lesson.

In this session we shall discuss how to use
magicks.

As with units, each magick has a charge time,
which starts when a unit begins to cast it,
and ends when the magick goes into effect.
Each magick also has a Speed attribute that
affects how quickly it charges.

The charge time for magicks begins when a
unit starts to cast them.

If the unit's next turn arrives before the
casting is complete, the unit cannot perform
another action without canceling the magick.
If the unit chooses the Wait command, it will
continue casting. The unit may also move
without interrupting the casting.
Perhaps the easiest way to learn about magick
is to actually use it.

First, select "Act" from the unit's menu.{END}

Now select "Black Magicks."{END}

The black magicks available to this unit
are displayed.

Magicks that are marked with the \xD110 icon
may be reflected with the Reflect ability.

The MP cost of casting the magick is shown
in the column labeled "MP."

The "Turn" column indicates when the magick
will actually go into effect.

All magicks require time to cast.


The Turn value tells you when the unit
will finish casting the magick in the
current turn order.
It is calculated based on the casting
unit's turn order and the amount of time
it takes to cast the magick.
You can press the left or right button to
see more detailed information.

Move the cursor to the spell whose timing
you wish to check, and press the left or
right button now.{END}

Empty{END}

The turn list is displayed. The flashing row
with the casting unit's name and the magick's
name indicates when the magick will be cast.
This list may also be viewed at any time by
pressing [Triangolo] and selecting "Turn List."

Now press [Simbolo B9] to return to the spell selection
menu.{END}

For now, try casting the first spell
on the list.{END}

The red tiles around the unit indicate the
magick's range.

You may select any of these tiles as the
target.

The targeted unit or units will be damaged
by offensive magicks, or aided by support
magicks.
Select that enemy unit's tile as your target.{END}

The green tiles around the target indicate
the magick's area of effect.

Any units within the the area of effect
will be affected.

Since you are casting an offensive magick,
units in the area of effect will be damaged.

Note that allied units and enemy units will
flash in different colors to help you
distinguish friend from foe.
Note that both allies and enemies can be
damaged by your magicks.

Therefore, you should always ensure that
there are no blue flashing units in the
area of effect.
You may turn off the flashing color effect
with option 10, "Target Colors."

Press [Croce] again to confirm your target.{END}

Next, choose whether you wish to target the
unit or the tile beneath him.

If you select "Unit," that unit will remain
the magick's target, even if he or she moves
while it is being cast.
If you select "Tile" and the unit moves
while the magick is being cast, the magick
will be cast upon the empty tile.
Choosing "Unit" ensures that a magick will affect
the targeted unit. But if the unit moves, the
magick may then affect your own units as well.
This time, let's select the unit as our target.{END}

Only one magick may be cast at a time. Starting
another action before the initial magick has
been cast will cancel it.
This concludes my explanation of magicks.


Let us review. Like units, magicks have a
charge time requirement and a Speed attribute.

Keep in mind the amount of time required to
cast magicks when choosing one.

When casting a magick, you must select a target
within its range. The magick will affect all
tiles in its area of effect.
You may choose to cast a magick on either a
unit or a tile.

If you cast a magick on a unit, the magick's
area of effect will move along with the
targeted unit.
If you cast a magick on a tile and there are no
units within the area of effect when the magick
is finally cast, the magick will be wasted.
Keep these points in mind to make the most
of your units' magicks.

With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.{END}

Understanding these concepts should allow you
to gain the upper hand in any battle you fight.

With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.{END}

Every time the CT gauge goes up, it increases
by an amount equal to the unit's Speed.

This means that units with a high Speed will
see their CT gauges fill up more quickly.{END}

If the attack was successful, the unit will gain
experience points (EXP) and job points (JP).

After a unit has both moved and acted, 
his or her turn will automatically end.

When a unit's turn ends, you must choose his or
her facing. This affects the probability of him
or her dodging enemy attacks.
You will want to be facing the enemy whenever
possible.{END}

This concludes my explanation of
movement and actions.

You will be repeating these steps many times
as you battle your foes.

This is one of the fundamentals of battle, so
please do your best to remember what you
have learned here.
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.{END}
