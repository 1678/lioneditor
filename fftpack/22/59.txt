[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Think matters through, Delita.
Where would you even go?
You must calm yourself!{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Calm myself? My only sister is taken by
cutthroats, and you would have me calm?{END}

I would have you obey reason! We know
not where to begin. To search now would
be fruitless.{END}

Fruitless!? You speak
of my sister's life!{END}

You heard...my lord brother.


He said he would not...abandon her.
But there's little...we can do-
Delita, I...cannot...breathe.{END}

Forgive me, <Ramza>.
Are you all right?{END}

I...I'll be fine...
*cough*{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]I'd not believe a word of that
fairy tale if I were you.{END}

You call my brother a liar?{END}

I do. I would not go out of -my- way
to rescue some common maid.{END}

What did you say?{END}

I said he would be a fool to hold back
an army for fear of spilling a few drops
of your common blood!{END}

As I thought.{END}

Stop this, Delita!{END}

Release me! Damn you, <Ramza>,
release me!{END}

Hmph. It's as I've always said: Common
blood, common man. You'll never be more
than you were born, Delita!
You don't belong in our world. You ought
be licking our boots with the rest of your
ilk, churl!{END}

That does it-!{END}

Enough, Delita!
And you as well, Argath!{END}

Open your eyes, <Ramza>!
Delita is not one of us!

It isn't proper that you should mix with
such as he. Surely you see that?{END}

Delita is my friend, and a dear one.
We've been as brothers all our lives!{END}

And that blinds you from the truth!


You're a man grown, <Ramza>.
It's time you left the playthings of your
boyhood behind.
You are a son of House Beoulve, a birth
high even among the highborn. Such company
ill suits you.
Your brothers see this, I am sure.
Even if you choose not to.{END}

Not everyone of high birth is as ill-bred as you.
I'll trust to <Ramza>'s judgment.{END}

Begone from my sight!
And do not think to return!{END}

Your words cut deep, <Ramza>.
Are we not friends?{END}

Remove yourself!
I'll not ask again!{END}

The Brigade makes its base at Ziekden.
Your lord brother told me himself.

You've no hope of breaching the fortress
from the fore. Their defenses are too strong.
A rear assault is your only chance.
Best of luck, my soft-hearted friend.
You'll need it.{END}

Begone!{END}
