[Portrait]Executioner
[Dialog]Got any words t' leave behin',
puppet?{END}

None, then? Just as well,
I s'pose.{END}

[Portrait]Gryphon Knight of Lionel
[Dialog]Is that-?

The enemy!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]We are come for the princess! Stand
down, or take her place on the gallows!{END}

Ha ha ha! And the
trap is sprung!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Trap?{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]<Ramza>, ever the gallant fool!{END}

What have you done with Lady
Ovelia!?{END}

I've done naught with her, she's at
Lionel. What of the gem?{END}

Gem?{END}

Might we spare ourselves these
tiresome feints? I speak of the
cardinal's gemstone.
The one who stole it travels with
you, does he not? I would have it
surrendered.{END}

If you want it, come and get it.{END}

So the boy now thinks himself a
man! Very well. Let us finish this
like men!{END}

[Portrait]Agrias
[Dialog]What is to be done
with Lady Ovelia?{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]I will return her to Gallionne,
as per my contract.
What Duke Larg does with her
after that is not my concern.{END}

Lord Dycedarg and the duke would
use her as a pawn in their game of
thrones!
Just as the two of them now use
you!

Is a man like you not ashamed to be
no more than a piece in their game?
Have you no pride-no honor?{END}

Such flights of fancy are long
since flown from me, my lady.{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]It is not too late to change your mind,
<Ramza>!
Return with me to Eagrose! Your brother
Dycedarg would fain forgive what's done.
He said as much himself!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Then let him forgive this as well, for
I'll play no part in his foul plots!{END}

Foul!? You would paint your
brother's deeds as -foul-?

A Beoulve must uphold the
duties of his station! You of
all people should know that!{END}

My lord brother seeks to ignite
war to further his own ends!

If such a thing is not foul, ser,
then pray tell what is!{END}

A man does not eat an omelette
without breaking eggs!

Blood is the price of progress!
It is the ink in which history's
pages are writ!
Look around you, boy!
Ivalice rots from within!

Your brother would carve out the
root of its decay, even if it means
his hands must needs be soiled!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]I will not stand and watch as Lady
Ovelia is made to be another Tietra!{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]Forget Ziekden! There was no
avoiding that.
You are an heir of House Beoulve,
<Ramza>, and you have a duty
as such!
It is your fate to see that duty
fulfilled!{END}

As it was my fate to let Tietra die?


No, fate had no hand in that. Tietra
died because I could not be bothered
to save her.
I've lied to myself all this time. It was
my own inaction that killed her!{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]You truly are a fool!

What is the life of one girl, when
weighed against the greater good?{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]I see no -good- in using people!
Only deception, and death!
I will not stand by any longer as
innocents fall prey to your -good-!

I will not let you harm the princess!{END}

Then you seal your fate,
you stubborn fool!{END}

[Portrait]Agrias
[Dialog]<Ramza>, you are
a Beoulve?{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]You didn't know?

Aye, this little whelp is a son
of the great House Beoulve.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]I am my father's son, but that does not
make me the same as my brothers!
I knew naught of the plot to kidnap the
princess! I swear it!{END}

Do you truly think I would doubt
you now? You have more than
proven yourself!{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]Curse me for a fool, I'd not thought
you'd grown so strong!
I'd best retreat for now.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]The castle-we must make haste!{END}
