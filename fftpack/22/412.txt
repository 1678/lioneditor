[Portrait]Master Darlavon
[Dialog]Now then, let us begin our lesson.

In this session, we shall delve into how to
control your units on the battlefield.

Since the battlefield is a three-dimensional
environment, you may view it from a
variety of angles.
Use the L and R buttons and the analog stick
to adjust your view of the battlefield.

The analog stick rotates your view of
the battlefield.{END}

The L button zooms the camera in and out,
and the R button toggles the camera height.{END}

Try using these controls now.
Press START when you are finished.{END}

You may also scroll across the screen by holding
down [Quadrato] and using the directional buttons.

Try it now, and press START when finished.{END}

You will need to master these controls if you
want to be aware of what is occurring on
the battlefield.
Next, we will cover the battlefield cursor.{END}

The battlefield cursor is used to select units
or tiles on the battlefield.

The cursor's height (h) is displayed in the upper
right corner of the screen, and the selected
unit's status is displayed at the bottom.
Press [Simbolo B9] to close the menu, then use the
directional buttons to move the battlefield
cursor.
Press START when you are finished.{END}

The cursor is used to select a unit's
movement destination or attack target.

Battlefields are often made up of complex
terrain, and some locations may be inaccessible.

The cursor is normally blue, but it will turn red
when moved over a tile inaccessible to the unit.

You now know the basics of controlling the
battlefield cursor.

Let us move on to something a bit more
advanced.

Sometimes you will encounter tiles that are
above other ones.

For example, you may be able to move over or
under a bridge.{END}

Allow me to explain how to use the cursor in
a case like this.

First, move the cursor to either the upper or
lower tile, then wait after moving the cursor.

It will automatically begin to toggle between
the upper and lower tiles.{END}

Simply make your selection when the cursor
is on the correct tile.

Try it now. Press START when you are
finished.{END}

You may adjust the speed of the cursor when
switching between levels by using option 3,
"Multi-height Toggle Rate."
If this option is turned off, the cursor will
not move automatically.

Instead, you must press START to toggle
between different levels.

There are also two other special ways of
moving the cursor, related to the units' turn
order.
To move the cursor automatically to the
active unit, move the cursor to an empty
tile and press [Croce].
Repeatedly pressing START will cycle
the cursor from unit to unit in turn order.

This is useful for determining the order in
which units will act.

However, you cannot use this method if you
are using START to switch between multiple
levels.{END}

Now allow me to explain the commands you may
use when selecting a unit with the cursor.

If you move the cursor to one of your units and
press [Croce], the unit's battle menu will appear.{END}

In addition, if you press [Simbolo B9] when a unit is
selected by the cursor, that unit's range of
movement will be displayed.{END}

This concludes our discussion of the
battlefield cursor.

Using the cursor is one of the fundamentals
of battle, so please do your best to remember
what you have learned here.
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.{END}
