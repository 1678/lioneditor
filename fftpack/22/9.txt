[Delay 02]Records of the hero Delita first[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]appear one year before the outbreak[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]of the War of the Lions[Delay 3C].[Delay 01]



[Delay 02]The loss of the Fifty Years' War saw knights[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]returning from the front stripped of livelihood[Delay 0F],[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]their fealty to the Crown and nobility abandoned[Delay 14].[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]Many became rogues and traitors[Delay 0F],[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]men donning the thief's cloak and[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]plotting treason against the Crown[Delay 3C].[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]It was a time of great unrest for Ivalice[Delay 14]-[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]murder and theft were commonplace[Delay 14].[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]Many were the young adventurer and mage[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]who stepped forward to counter this threat[Delay 14].[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]Of such, the city of Gariland, too,[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]saw its share..[Delay 3C].[Delay 01]{END}

[Dialog]Another wain was struck last night on its
way to Eagrose.{END}

[Portrait]Apprentice
[Dialog]The Corpse Brigade again?
{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]I wonder where all this leads...
Delita, what do you make of this?{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]I'm not sure. I have my guesses, but...{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]I'm listening.{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]I think Duke Larg is coming to Gariland.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Duke Larg? Why?
{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Not just the duke. The marquis Elmdore
de Limberry, too.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]That's the first I've heard of it. This has
not the sound of a state visit.{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]All of Ivalice is in turmoil.

The Order's supposed to be keeping
things under control, but the fact is,
they number too few.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]And they mean to bolster their numbers
with us?{END}

[Portrait]Man's Voice
[Dialog]All right, everybody,
form up!{END}

[Portrait]Knight of the Order
[Dialog]The Order of the Northern Sky has an
assignment for its knights apprentice.
As I'm sure you're already aware, the
number of brigands roaming Gallionne
is on the rise.
Among them, the Corpse Brigade...a seditious
lot with a grudge against the Crown. Rogues
such as they must be dealt with.
The Order has been commanded to undertake
an operation to eliminate the Brigade-an
operation of a grand scale.
We will not be acting alone. The Order will be
joined by, among others, His Excellency Duke
Larg's royal guard, stationed at Eagrose.
This will leave Eagrose Castle undermanned.
Your task will be to proceed there, and support
us from the rear by bolstering its defenses.{END}

[Portrait]Knight of the Order
[Dialog]The time to take up arms is upon you,
young apprentices!
I've just received word that a band of
thieves routed by our knights flees here
to Gariland, seeking refuge.
We will move to stop them, and finish the
task of our brothers. You, young apprentices,
will accompany us.
This is but a squall before the storm of
battle. Prepare yourselves at once!
Dismissed!{END}
