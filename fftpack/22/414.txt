[Portrait]Master Darlavon
[Dialog]Now then, let us begin the lesson.

In this session we shall explore the
fundamentals of battle, from beginning to end.

Firstly, you must select the units you wish to
use in battle and position them on the field.

The number of units you may use in battle
varies depending upon the situation, but in
general, you are limited to five.
In some cases, you may need to split your
units into two separate squads.

If you always use the same units in battle,
their advancement will soon outpace that of
your other units.
When selecting units to use in battle, keep
in mind both their skills and their need for
advancement.
Sometimes allied units will appear in battle
without your having selected them. These
are known as guest units.{END}

Guest units have their own agendas
and will move and act on their own.{END}

Once you have selected your units, you will
move to the battlefield.

And then, battle will begin-but we are getting
ahead of ourselves. First, we must discuss
objectives.
For example, this...{END}

Or, this...{END}

Messages such as these will appear as each
battle begins, telling you what you must do
in order to win.
In general, you must defeat all of the enemies,
but in some cases, you must fulfill other special
conditions.{END}

Once the battle has begun, each of your units
will move and act in turn.

When it is a unit's turn to move and act, he or
she will be designated by the AT icon, which
stands for Active Turn.
A unit's turn comes when his or her charge
time (CT) gauge reaches 100.

A unit's Speed attribute determines how much
his or her CT gauge fills with each tick of
the game clock.
During a unit's turn, he or she may move and
perform actions such as attacking an enemy.

Let's examine the battle menu, shall we?{END}

The Move, Act, and Wait commands are
displayed only when it is the unit's turn.

A unit may move once and act once during
his or her turn.

If the unit has both moved and performed
an action, his or her turn will automatically
come to an end.
The Wait command is used to end the turn if
the unit will only be moving or acting, or if he
or she will do nothing.
Next, let's examine the other commands.


Status allows you to check a unit's detailed
status.{END}

The AI command allows you to set an AI
pattern for the unit so that it will decide
its own actions.
Units that use AI will move and fight
automatically until the AI command is
canceled.{END}

You may select from four different AI
strategies.

Berserker will cause the unit to attack its
target without regard for his or her own
safety.
Defender will cause the unit to protect a
friendly target without regard for his or
her own safety.
Healer will cause the unit to focus upon
restoring the HP and MP of allied units.

Coward will cause the unit to attempt to
escape to a safe location while recovering
his or her own HP.
For Berserker and Defender, you must
select a target for the unit to attack or
protect.
Once a unit's AI has been enabled, that unit
will fight automatically from then on.

To cancel this setting, select the AI command
and choose Manual.

However, since the unit will be acting
automatically, you cannot access the unit's
menu on his or her own turn.
You must cancel the setting during another
unit's turn or after pausing the battle.{END}

The Status and AI commands may be selected
even if it is not the selected unit's turn.

Normally, the menu will not appear for an
enemy unit or a unit which has been set to
use AI.
However, you may halt the course of battle
and force a menu to appear by pressing [Triangolo].

Doing so will open a menu on the next unit's
turn.{END}

This allows you to stop units using AI, or to
view the status of enemy units.

You will not be able to give commands
to any of your units while the battle is
stopped in this way.
To resume the battle (assuming the current
unit is not set to AI), select "Done."

This command may be found at the
bottom of the menu.{END}

This concludes my overview of battle commands.


To summarize, you may select "Move," "Act,"
or "Wait" during a unit's turn, as well as check
the unit's status.
In some cases, you may wish to set an AI
pattern for a unit. To resume the battle after
it has been interrupted, select "Done."
These are the main commands that you will
use in the course of a battle.{END}

Next is a most unpleasant subject.


When a unit's HP reaches zero, the unit
will be KO'd.{END}

If you do not revive a KO'd unit within a
certain amount of time, the unit's body
will disappear.
In its place, a treasure chest or crystal will
appear.{END}

Once a unit has disappeared in this way,
there is no way of reviving it. The unit is
gone forever.
If one of your units is KO'd, do your best to
revive him or her as quickly as possible.

If all of your units are KO'd, the game is over.


Always keep an eye upon your units'
remaining HP to prevent this from happening.

I recommend that you always bring at least
one unit who is capable of healing or reviving
KO'd units.
On the other hand, KO'ing all enemy units
on the battlefield will end the battle, assuming
you have fulfilled the battle objective.{END}

This concludes our battle overview and my
explanation of the battle menu.

I trust you will make good use of this
information on the battlefield.

With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.{END}

The Status and AI commands may be selected
even if it is not the selected unit's turn.

Normally, the menu will not appear for an
enemy unit or a unit which has been set to
use AI.
However, you may halt the course of battle
and force a menu to appear by pressing [Triangolo].

Doing so will open a menu on the next unit's
turn.

This allows you to stop units using AI, or to
view the status of enemy units.

You will not be able to give commands
to any of your units while the battle is
stopped in this way.
To resume the battle (assuming the current
unit is not set to AI), select "Done."

This command may be found at the
bottom of the menu.{END}

This concludes my overview of battle commands.


To summarize, you may select "Move," "Act,"
or "Wait" during a unit's turn, as well as check
the unit's status.
In some cases, you may wish to set an AI
pattern for a unit. To resume the battle after
