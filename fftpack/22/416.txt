[Portrait]Master Darlavon
[Dialog]Now then, let us begin the lesson.

In this session, I shall explain movement and
actions.

A unit is allowed one move and one action
during his or her turn.

Let's try controlling a unit as he moves
and acts.

First, you must move your unit to a tile
next to the enemy you wish to attack.

Try selecting "Move."{END}

As you can see, the tiles around your unit are
flashing blue.

These blue tiles indicate the movement range
of your unit. You must select a destination from
among these tiles.
But first, allow me to explain how a unit's
movement range is determined.

Each unit's range of movement is determined by
his or her Move and Jump attributes.

On flat terrain, a unit may move a number of
tiles in one turn equal to the unit's Move
attribute.
So, if a unit's Move is 4, he or she may move
4 tiles.

Likewise, the unit may perform a vertical jump
to a height equaling his or her Jump attribute.

He or she may also jump horizontally for a
distance equaling half his or her Jump attribute.

So, a unit with a Jump of 3 could jump
horizontally over a 1-tile gap, or jump up
or down 3 levels.
In this case, "levels" refer to the difference
between the height of the unit's current tile and
that of the target tile.
Now then, let us continue practicing movement.


Once the unit's movement range is displayed,
select a destination.

If there is an allied chocobo on the tile you
select, your unit will mount that chocobo.{END}

Now try approaching the enemy by selecting
the tile directly in front of him.{END}

Since a unit may only move once per turn, the
Move command is now grayed out and cannot
be selected.
Now try attacking with a weapon.


To do this, you must select the Attack
command.

Try it now. Select "Act" and then "Attack."{END}

The tiles around your unit have turned red.


This indicates the unit's attack range.
He may attack any unit on a red tile.

Allow me to explain a bit about attack range.


A unit's attack range is determined by the
weapon a unit has equipped, as well as his
or her abilities.
For example, a sword has a range of only one
tile, but a bow allows a unit to extend his or
her attack to tiles that are quite far away.
Magicks generally have a long range as well.


Next, try selecting your target. Move the
cursor to your enemy and press [Croce].{END}

Notice that the enemy unit's tile has turned
green.

Green tiles indicate the attack's area of
effect.

The area of effect depends upon the weapon
a unit has equipped, as well as his or her
abilities.
Most weapons have an area of effect of just
one tile, but magicks may affect many tiles
at once.
The status of each unit is displayed at the
bottom of the screen.

On the left is the attacking unit, and on the
right is his or her target.

The attacking unit's turn order, level,
and EXP are not shown here.

In place of them, you will see an estimate
of the attack's effect. The HP value listed
here is the estimated amount of damage.
To the right is the probability that
the attack will succeed.

By checking these, you can get a good idea of
how effective an attack will be against a
particular enemy.
For standard attacks, only the damage
estimate and chance of success are
displayed.
For magicks that cause status effects, the
status effect's name and its chance of being
inflicted will also be displayed.
If the targeted unit has a reaction ability,
the name of that ability will appear beneath
the unit's status display.
In battle, it is important to check all of
these when choosing a target.

You should also note that a unit's Bravery,
Faith, and zodiac sign all affect the damage
and success rate of attacks.
A unit's Bravery also affects its bare-handed
Attack attribute and the chance that its
reaction ability will be triggered.
Faith affects the damage and success rate
of a unit's magick attacks.

For example, a unit with high Faith inflicts
more damage when casting Firaga, and is
more like to successfully cast Raise.
The relationship between the zodiac signs
of the attacker and defender also affects
damage and success rate.
If the two signs are compatible, attacks
will do more damage and healing magicks
will be more effective.
If the two signs are incompatible, damage
will be reduced, as will the success rate
of magicks.
The estimated results of an attack take
into account Faith, Bravery, and zodiac
sign compatibility.
Now then, let us continue by selecting the
target.

Once you have checked the area of effect
and estimated results, you may confirm
your target.
Press [Croce] to confirm the selection.{END}

If an attack is successful, the attacker will
gain experience points (EXP) and job points
(JP).
After a unit has both moved and acted, 
his or her turn will automatically end.

When a unit's turn ends, you must choose his or
her facing. This affects the probability of the
unit evading enemy attacks.
You will want to be facing the enemy whenever
possible.{END}

That concludes my explanation of
movement and actions.

You shall be repeating these steps many times
as you battle your foes.

This is one of the fundamentals of battle, so
please do your best to remember what you
have learned here.
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.{END}
