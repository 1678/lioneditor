[Portrait]Gragoroth
[Dialog]Back whence you came! Quick as shadows, or
this one's blood makes crimson snow!
Do not think to try my patience! This keep
packs such a store of powder as you could
scarce imagine!
More than enough to deliver the lot of you to
the Father's keeping, should your feet lack
proper haste!{END}

[Portrait]Zalbaag
[Dialog]The Order of the Northern Sky yields
not before the braying of rogues!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Lord Brother! Argath!{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Tietra!{END}

[Portrait]Tietra
[Dialog]Delita-!{END}

Withdraw at once! I'll
not warn you again!{END}

This changes nothing, Argath.
Loose your attack!{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]Yes, my lord!{END}

Gods have mercy...{END}

D-Delita... I'm...sorry...{END}

Tietra-!{END}

[Portrait]Northern Sky Knight
[Dialog]Lord Commander! More enemies
scale the pass.
Two score, mayhap three. A man of
Wiegraf's look moves among them!{END}

Very well. We go to greet them at once.
I leave the rest to you, Argath.{END}

Curse the lot of you...{END}

Tietra!{END}

And where do you presume to go, Delita?{END}

You whoreson dog!{END}

It is to be a fight, then? I'm only too happy
to oblige!{END}

Zalbaag... Dycedarg...
How could you?{END}

Come! I will show you that common blood
makes naught but a common man!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Why did you do it, Argath?
What moved your hand?{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]Your lord brother's orders,
<Ramza>. What else?
Would you have had us kneel before them,
and offer up the Order's honor in exchange
for the life of some common wench?{END}

She was Delita's sister!{END}

Is it not time you awoke to the fact
that we are different from them?

They are of lesser birth, and so meant
to play lesser roles in life! Such is the
nature of fate, <Ramza>!  
That commoner and his sister ought
never have been here at all!

Had they been mongering flowers on
some street corner, she would yet live.{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]What of you, <Ramza>? Why do
you now raise arms against us?
To turn your blade on us is treason! You
would turn your cloak and name yourself a
traitor to the Order of the Northern Sky?{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]But-the Order would never forgive
what you've done!{END}

Does your naivety know no end?
How ironic is fate, that one such
as you would be born a Beoulve!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]My birth was not of my choosing!{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]Spare me the bleating, you are no sheep!
You are a Beoulve, self-chosen or not!
Yours is a line of champions, of lords
among men! To do great deeds is your
destiny, and your duty as well.
Much is there that cannot be done, save
by your hand. It falls to you to see it so-
to act where we cannot.{END}

I will not be made a puppet!{END}

You? A puppet? Don't be absurd!


The puppets stand before you,
<Ramza>!

Long have we danced for House Beoulve,
that it might reign on history's stage.

A dance that serves our ends, to be sure.
The Beoulve name is our shield, behind
whose aegis we've long thrived.
It is the way of things! People are used,
and use others in turn. How do you think
you came to be where you are?
You are loath to be used, yet you fain
use others. Even your so-called friend
Delita!{END}

What do you mean?{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]Do not pretend at ignorance. You know
what must be done for name's sake.
You made that much clear on Mandalia
Plain, when you put orders ahead of
aiding me!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]I-!{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]You play the white knight, but I'd feed panthers
on the plain save you'd seen some use in me!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Don't be absurd! I would never turn my back
on a man beset!{END}

Then you'd best learn to start! Many a
trap-sprung lion would sooner have
his savior for a meal than for a friend.{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Make your peace with the gods,
Argath! You die by my hand!{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]Does it grieve you, Delita, to see the
depths of your own weakness laid bare?   
No mere commoner can leave his mark
on history! You've not the power!

Be glad you know enough to lament it.
'Tis all you can do, and more than you
deserve!{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Is your forked tongue done flitting? What
I'd hear from your lips are not words!{END}

Laughter, then? Be not so hasty, Delita!
You'll hear that soon enough, when you
are on your way to your dear sister's side!{END}

I'll not be told what I will do, or when!
Not by you, nor by any other!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Delita, you're hurt!{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Speak not to me! When Argath falls, my
vengeance turns on you, <Ramza>!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Delita...{END}

[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]N-no... Not at...the hands of...milksop
rabble...{END}
