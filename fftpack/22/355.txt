[Dialog]That's the last of it. The winds bear
it onward now.
And fair winds they are. They should
keep it airborne for a half-day if they
hold-more than time enough.{END}

Now there is a creature I had not
thought to find in these wastes!{END}

One might say the same of a Knight
Templar so far from the Church.

What is it you scatter to the wind?{END}

Oh, that?


I suppose there's no harm in your
knowing. There's naught you can
do to stop it now.{END}

Stop what!?{END}

This.{END}

Poison!{END}

Yes. Ground into a fine powder and cast
upon the winds toward the Northern Sky.

The toxin will not kill the men who breathe
it-but it will wither their constitution,
rendering them unable to fight.{END}

But why? The High Confessor stands
to gain naught by handing victory to
Goltanna!{END}

Nor does he think to.


The moment Goltanna hears of the
Northern Order's plight, he will send his
armies against them.
With his own stronghold unguarded, Goltanna
will be an easy target for assassination, and
Count Orlandeau with him.
But do not think Duke Larg will escape this
scourge-his is the easy death to achieve.

Amidst the coming chaos, who could say
how Duke Larg might meet his end?
{END}

You're inhuman!{END}

You ought rejoice! This will mean
an end to war and bloodshed.

And with that end, a new beginning.
The Church's hand shall rule. Such
is the will of the people.
They clamor for change-an end to
groveling at highborn heels.{END}

The war will end, but not like this.
There is another way!{END}

I expected you'd say as much-no matter!{END}

[Dialog]Once you've put a stop to this
fighting, what then?
How do you propose to purge
Ivalice of her corruption?

Her fever will not cease to rage till
her festered limbs are cut and seared!
Even you must see that now!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]You would cut away the pure flesh with
the foul.
There is corruption, yes, but there are
also good men in Ivalice, and they are
not few!
There are ways to heal a festered
wound without the knife. The poison
can be drawn!{END}

Pray tell what poultice might draw
the nobles from this land!

So long as you blight it with your
existence, we must bow to your
whims.
A man alone might know equality.
Two men, never! One will ever seek
to exploit the other.
And I will not be exploited! I will
claim your seat, and take what is
my due.
I should think I have at least that right!{END}

You think to cure the realm's corruption
by becoming part of it?

What when another comes to claim your
seat? You care not for Ivalice's suffering-
you care only for your own!{END}

Such righteous words! More the
greater your hypocrisy!{END}

[Dialog]No! I was not...not
to die like this...{END}
