We've reached the bottom of the barrel.
Our rations will soon be gone.
What now? Strike another wain?{END}

[Portrait]Northern Sky Deserter[Dialog]
I think not.

Our numbers swell. The time
is ripe we sacked a village.

We've scavenged scraps for long enough.
Let us feast now from the table!{END}

You'd have us raid a town? I cannot
help but feel that goes too far.{END}

Too far!? Who was it stood on the front
lines at Besselat? You-and I! And this,
our recompense?
We risked our lives, while those damnable
Beoulves fled for theirs. Let them reap
now what they've sown!
Steal and plunder till there's naught left.
What we take is what we're due.{END}

[Portrait]Northern Sky Deserter[Dialog]
And if the Order should appear?{END}

We give them a fifth, and they
disappear just as quick.{END}

Ha! I like it. That's why
we follow you!{END}

Mayhap you've some wits after all.{END}

Someone approaches!{END}

More come to fill our ranks, eh?{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>[Dialog]
So, you're the turncloaks who 
dishonor the Order's name!
I'll abide your crimes no longer.
Yield now, and keep your lives.{END}

"Yield," the boy says!{END}

Beg pardons, milord. I'm afraid we're
not very good at yielding. Lack of
experience and whatnot.
We'd be happy to let you on your
way, though. With one condition:
Leave us that wench.{END}

[Portrait]Agrias[Dialog]
You craven worm!

Think you women sport? Then be glad,
for I've no mind to leave-not until I've
had that tongue from your throat!{END}

Oh, you'll have far more than that,
sweetness!{END}

[Portrait]Northern Sky Deserter[Dialog]
Boss, is that not...the Thunder God!?

There's no mistake! I fought him and
his men once at Dugeura Pass!{END}

[Portrait]Northern Sky Deserter[Dialog]
Don't be absurd, the count was slain
at Besselat!
He's just another dead man, and
all dead men look the same!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>[Dialog]
Why lower yourselves to this?

Did you not join the Order to
protect the people?{END}

[Portrait]Northern Sky Deserter[Dialog]
Are you daft, boy? We joined the Order
to make a knight's living!
And what a living it's been-driven on
like beasts of burden, denied our pay
and even proper rations!
Would that honor flavored soup, I might
have use for it. But I've had my fill of
boiled lentils.{END}

[Portrait]Agrias[Dialog]
There are people who lack any food at
all, and you scorn what you are given?
You steal from the poor that you might
grow fat! Know you how many hunger
and die because of what you do?{END}

[Portrait]Northern Sky Deserter[Dialog]
What's it to me how many die?{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>[Dialog]
It's not your bellies that are empty-it's
your souls!{END}

If you would rob others of the
right to live, then you've no claim
to it, either!{END}

[Portrait]Orlandeau[Dialog]
Do you see, my friend? Your spirit yet
lives on.
The time for cautious restraint is past.
Let justice now be served!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>[Dialog]
It is times such as these when the people
-need- the Orders to protect them.{END}

[Portrait]Agrias[Dialog]
Ivalice weakens, and so the vultures
come to feed.
We'll no doubt see more before the
end. This strife must be quelled,
<Ramza>-and soon.{END}
