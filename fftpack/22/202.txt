[Portrait]Duke Goltanna
[Dialog]My advisors tell me you are the one who rescued
Princess Ovelia. I would have you tell me more.{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]I am Delita Heiral, a Blackram lieutenant in the 
service of His Excellency the Baron Grimms.
His Excellency dispatched me to rescue the
princess. And so I did, disguised as one of your
own-a sheep in Lion's clothing.
Now I have returned.{END}

[Portrait]Chancellor Glevanne
[Dialog]Heiral, you say? That is a name I've not
heard before.{END}

[Portrait]Duke Goltanna
[Dialog]I thought Baron Grimms and his Blackrams
felled in battle against the Eye a fortnight past.{END}

Indeed. That dark news spurred me to
return with all the greater haste.{END}

How fares the princess?{END}

[Portrait]Bishop Canne-Beurich
[Dialog]She is weary yet from her long journey.
She sleeps as if among the dead.{END}

[Portrait]Count Cidolfus Orlandeau
[Dialog]Is it not true you brought a prisoner?{END}

It is.


Bring the prisoner forth!{END}

Let us hear the reason for your
attempt on the princess.{END}

[Portrait]Prisoner
[Dialog]'Twas to stain Duke Goltanna's
name, and keep him from Lesalia.
We thought to deny him the regent's
seat.{END}

Who gave you the order?
Duke Larg?{END}

No...a close adviser of Duke Goltanna's
seeking to curry Duke Larg's favor.{END}

[Portrait]Chancellor Glevanne
[Dialog]Madness! None among us would
fain betray our duke!
Silence this man, he knows not
of what he speaks!{END}

I would hear it nonetheless.{END}

Who was it?{END}

...{END}

Name the one who gave the order!{END}

I'd have your protection?{END}

On my honor as a knight.
Speak!{END}

'Twas the man who stands before me.
Chancellor Glevanne.{END}

What!? How dare you! I do not even
know you, knave!{END}

Who put you to it?
The queen?{END}

Stop this mummer's farce,
I've naught to do with this!{END}

To betray your liege lord is an
unpardonable crime, Chancellor.{END}

It was not I! I know naught of it!{END}

Forgive me if I presume overmuch, Your
Grace, but now is not the time for
bandied words.
The Order of the Southern Sky must
march on Lesalia at once, and you with
it!
Give your enemies but a moment to
collect themselves, and they will pin
the chancellor's sedition on his lord.
Your Grace must strike before they are
given the chance! Deny the prince's claim,
and set the princess on the throne!{END}

[Delay 02]Following his sack of[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]the royal capital of Lesalia[Delay 0F],[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]Duke Goltanna banished Queen Louveria[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]to Besselat for her hand in the conspiracy[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]and crowned Princess Ovelia queen[Delay 3C].[Delay 01]

[Delay 02]But Duke Larg[Delay 0F],[Delay 02] insisting[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]that Prince Orinus was[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]the true and rightful heir[Delay 0F],[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]at once crowned the child-prince[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]and declared himself regent[Delay 3C].[Delay 01]

[Delay 02]Moving then to free the queen[Delay 0F],[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]Duke Larg dispatched the[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]Order of the Northern Sky to Besselat[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]in the name of the new-crowned king[Delay 1E].[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]Duke Goltanna in turn set the Southern Sky[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]to march in Ovelia's name[Delay 3C].[Delay 01]


[Delay 02]The curtain had risen on what history[Delay 01]
[Delay 02]would one day record as the War of the Lions.[Delay 78] [Delay 01]{END}
