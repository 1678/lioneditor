[Portrait]Wiegraf
[Dialog]Your faces are known to me. But I did not know
that you would one day kill my sister.
Milleuda deserved a better death-they did not
even send proper knights to kill her!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]She was your sister...
I am sorry.{END}

I will not flee before her murderers. I'll venge
Milleuda's death or die in the trying!{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]My sister, Tietra-you will set her free!{END}

[Portrait]Wiegraf
[Dialog]Your sister? Then you are a Beoulve, yes?{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]He is not. If it is a Beoulve you
seek, address yourself to me!{END}

So, Gragoroth has erred. But surely
the girl must hold some connection
with House Beoulve?{END}

You draw no distinction between our
house and those who deal with us?{END}

Should I?


Well, it matters not. There was no
question as to her release. We make
no habit of holding hostages.
But first we've a score to settle.
You will see her free-if you live
to see aught at all!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Lay down your arms, Wiegraf!
What end will more deaths serve?{END}

[Portrait]Wiegraf
[Dialog]What end did my sister's death serve?{END}

We did not set out to kill her!


This quarrel need not be settled by
the sword. Let us treat, and persist
not in this bloodshed!{END}

You see it not-the reason we hold fast to
our steel!

What advantage might I hope to enjoy at the
treaty table? And who would set a seat for
me there? You?
Even were it in your power, your brothers
would never heed any agreement we might
reach!{END}

My brothers do not want this fight!
Set down your sword, Wiegraf, and
my brothers will treat with you!{END}

Ha! No spoony bard could spin a sweeter
tale!

You say your brothers do not want this
fight? Tears then, for the world you see
is one beyond my weary sight.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]You would have me believe my brothers
plot at war?{END}

[Portrait]Wiegraf
[Dialog]Callow child. The hands that guide history's
reins are ever black with blood.
Think you Dycedarg's hand more just?
A new justice is born and dies on the lips
of each man who would pronounce it.{END}

Do not mock my brothers!{END}

[Portrait]Wiegraf
[Dialog]You fight well, boy.

Forgive me, Milleuda! But there is too much
left undone for me to lay down my life now.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Wiegraf, wait!{END}

Who do you think sent Gustav to
kidnap Marquis Elmdore?

It was none other than your lord
brother, Dycedarg. With Lord
Zalbaag's approval, to be sure.{END}

Absurd! Why would Dycedarg
do such a thing?{END}

The Lions vie for power in the void left by
the king's death.

I speak, of course, of Larg, the White Lion,
and Goltanna, the Black.

Each hopes to learn who may be counted
as friend, and who as foe. But such things
are not so easily read.
Easier rid yourself of those whose loyalty is
uncertain, and install others to rule in their
stead.
I fear Gustav, fool that he was, tired of our
rebellion, and was taken in by the silver
tongue of your dear brother, Dycedarg.{END}

Lies! No Beoulve would do a thing
so craven as this!{END}

Do not take my word for it. Judge their actions
for yourself. Farewell, young Beoulve.{END}

Wiegraf! Coward! You insult my name,
and flee in the same breath!{END}
