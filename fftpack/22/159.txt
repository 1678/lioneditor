[Portrait]Cardinal Delacroix
[Dialog]I see, Lady Agrias.

In such circumstance as this, I am fain to lend
you whatever help I can.

I shall dispatch a courier to Mullonde at once.
High Confessor Marcel will have this news
from my own hand.
We will expose Duke Larg's misdeeds, and ensure
that no harm befall you, Princess.{END}

Your Eminence, think you the High Confessor
will hear our plea?{END}

Fear not, dear lady. You are in my care now.


Princess Ovelia can scarce feel at ease while
those tasked with her safety are vexed with
such worriment.
You may enjoy the comforts of the castle-
wanting though they are-while we await a
reply from Mullonde.{END}

[Portrait]Ovelia
[Dialog]You are most gracious, Eminence. Thank you.{END}

So long as Saint Ajora is our guide, we have
naught to fear, child.

As for you, my young machinist, I have given
consideration to your troubles as well.

I will send a hand-picked company of my finest
men to Goug to put an end to this Baert
Trading Company.{END}

[Portrait]Mustadio
[Dialog]Thank you, Your Eminence.{END}

Conditioned upon this: I would hear the reason
they choose to pursue you and your father.{END}

That is-I mean to say it's not-{END}

Come, come. Mayhap this will
give voice to your words.{END}

A crystal?{END}

You are familiar with the legend of
the Zodiac Braves?{END}

In my youth, I often heard a fanciful
tale of that name at mass.{END}

What's this? Surely, Lady Agrias, you
do not aver that the Church would
mislead its flock?{END}

No-no, of course not, Your Eminence.{END}

Long ago, before the mountains had ceased their
wandering and struck their roots into the earth,
the Lucavi held dominion over the world.
Twelve heroes there were, who came forward
to challenge these Lucavi.

In a long and bitter struggle, they succeeded
in driving the Lucavi to the spirit world, and
Ivalice again knew peace.
The Twelve each bore an auracite crystal
emblazoned with a house of the night sky.

And so in time, they became known as the
Zodiac Braves.

Ever after, when discord and strife paid visit
to the halls of men, they would return to save
us once more.{END}

You have clearly been a most apt pupil,
Princess.{END}

Elder Simon himself instructed me at
Orbonne-which reminds me of another
thing he said.
Saint Ajora walked with the Twelve, and 
together they saved Ivalice from ruin.{END}

We call the crystals of the Twelve
the "Zodiac Stones."

The stone you see before you now
is a stone from that very legend.{END}

Auracite-it exists? I did not think it possible.{END}

Or that it held the sacred power to keep the
Lucavi at bay, eh?

I confess, I feel some power deep within, but
my eyes see only a common crystal.{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Mustadio, are you well? The color has
left your face.{END}

You have seen a stone like this one
beneath Goug, have you not?{END}

Machines whose fires have long since
guttered out lie strewn in the tunnels
beneath the city.
But pass that Stone near them, and you
can hear them stir.{END}

Then Baert seeks the auracite, eh?{END}

I do not know what power these Zodiac
Stones hold.

I know only that Ludovich Baert hopes to
find some way to harness this power, and
make a fearsome weapon.
My father would not give them the Stone,
so they took him instead.{END}

Put your worries from your mind, my
young machinist.

The Church will see this matter is dealt
with. Our forces will strike, and wrest
the Stone from their hands.{END}

Of...of course, Your Eminence.{END}

I will join the company that makes for Goug.{END}

Thank you, <Ramza>.{END}

We would never have succeeded in reaching
His Eminence the Cardinal without you,
<Ramza>.
You have my thanks, as well.{END}

I can only wish you well-small aid, I know.{END}

Your words are all the aid I could ever ask.{END}
