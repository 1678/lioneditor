[Portrait]Grand Duke Barrington
[Dialog]Ah, a warmest welcome to you both. I do hope
you've found my halls to your pleasure.
They may lack the grandeur of Lesalia's, but
I find they make up for it in other ways.

Castles built as seats of governance are so
dreadfully plain. Would you not agree?

There is such greater beauty in a fortress
built for war.

Ivalice herself would seem to be in agreement.
Ever has she been ruled by men with power.

Some might take this latest upheaval as a
sign that the Crown-in its austere seat-
has lost the strength to keep her under rein.{END}

[Portrait]Folmarv
[Dialog]Your summons spoke of matters more
pressing than the style of Lesalia's keep.{END}

Must everyone be in such haste?{END}

Very well, I shall ask you outright.
Will you not join your strength with
mine?{END}

I am afraid your meaning escapes
me, Your Grace.{END}

As I said a moment ago, it is -power- that
rules Ivalice.

Who do you think now holds power? Duke
Larg, and the Order of the Northern Sky?

Duke Goltanna, mayhap, with the Southern
Sky's swords at his beck and call?

No, I can assure you it is not they. The ones
who hold true power are the ones who hold
the Zodiac Stones-the Knights Templar.{END}

You think us the greatest power
in Ivalice?{END}

The Stones are said to possess
phenomenal magick.

If legend is to be believed, they were
responsible for the cataclysm that laid
waste to Mullonde in bygone days.{END}

Ah ha ha! Oh, forgive me. I forget
myself.

It's just-I would never have expected
a man like yourself to believe in such
utter fantasy.{END}

You mean to tell me that you do not?


Curious. I had heard that the cardinal's
death was somehow connected to the
Stones.{END}

Truly? As I had it, the cardinal had
taken ill.{END}

Is that so? Might I ask, then, the reason
you seek that young Beoulve?

I can only imagine what he must have
done to earn the label of heretic.{END}

The inquisitors do not share with us
the reasons for their decisions.{END}

So, you know nothing at all.
How terribly convenient!

Still, I wonder if there could not
be some detail you are simply
forgetting.
Marach!{END}

[Portrait]Isilud
[Dialog]Father... F-forgive me.{END}

Hmph. Your meaning becomes
clearer.{END}

I've taken Scorpio and Taurus
for safekeeping.{END}

You worthless fool of a son!{END}

[Portrait]Riovanesian Guard
[Dialog]Pardon my intrusion, Your Grace, but
your long-awaited guests are at our gate.{END}

Marach, would you kindly see
to them?{END}

What is it you wish, Barrington?{END}

Cooperation. I said as much a few moments
ago. It would be a mutually beneficial
arrangement, I assure you.{END}

And if we were to refuse?{END}

Then I suppose I'd be forced to unmask the
Church's plot for what it is.{END}

Stones alone prove naught.{END}

In that you are correct, ser.


But it would be hard to say the same of the
Scriptures of Germonique.

I dare contend they might generate something
more of a stir. Duke Larg, Duke Goltanna-
even the Council is like to raise an eye at those.{END}

Where are they?{END}

Oh, who could say? You of all
people must know how easily such
details can elude the mind's grasp.{END}

Wiegraf, see to the mage who
left a moment ago. I shall attend
to matters here.{END}

Do not think to threaten me! This is
a battle you cannot hope to win.{END}

No, it is one we cannot hope to
lose.

Who is there to oppose us, save
you feeble-bodied humans?{END}

Father...?{END}

You misjudge the strength of your
enemy, Grand Duke Barrington.
There will be no sport in killing you.{END}

You would raise arms against
your host under his own roof!?{END}

The hospitality of your hall grows cold.
I fear I shall have to take my leave, once
I've shown you the power of the Stones!{END}
