[Dialog]No guards. Passing strange.{END}

Zalbaag's mount.{END}

Now to get inside...{END}

[Portrait]Dycedarg
[Dialog]Have you taken leave of your senses, Zalbaag?
This is madness!{END}

[Portrait]Zalbaag
[Dialog]After what you've done, you think yourself fit
to lead our house?{END}

That business with the duke? Larg was long
dead ere my dagger found its mark.

Think, Brother. He was a weak man, who relied
on others to fight where he could not.

More fool he for starting a war he could not
stomach.{END}

Our liege lord's murder bothers me not half so
much as our father's!

How could you dirty your hands with his blood?
What manner of son are you?{END}

I am my father's son! I know naught of his
murder!{END}

Duke Larg's dying words. I could scarce
believe my ears, but there was no mistaking
what he said.
Why did you kill him, Dycedarg?
Why!?{END}

[Portrait]Northern Sky Knight
[Dialog]Lord Dycedarg!{END}

Zalbaag is taken with some madness!{END}

Seize him!{END}

Lord Brother!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Stand your ground, Zalbaag!{END}

[Portrait]Zalbaag
[Dialog]<Ramza>! It is all as you've said!

Dycedarg enkindled this war and slew the duke.
All to feed his own ambition.

He has sullied our name, brought scorn upon
our house-he must be made to pay!{END}

He shall, Lord Brother!{END}

[Portrait]Dycedarg
[Dialog]You fools! Why will you not follow where I
lead? Why do you turn against me?
The powerful must rule the weak!
It is our duty!

The Crown once held such power, but no more!
See how fate has brought it low?

Why should we not rule in its stead? We must
wield our power and seize the reins of Ivalice!

Why will you not see this?{END}

[Portrait]Zalbaag
[Dialog]You feast on power, Brother, but leave no
place at table for justice.
The name Beoulve befits brave men who
raise their swords in justice's name. You
are no Beoulve!{END}

Justice? I'd die of shame to hear the word
from my own lips!

Such lofty ideals cannot rule a people so
common.

Who has earned you the right to wield your
sword of justice? To be hailed as hero?

Is it not I? I, who have dirtied my hands to
keep yours clean? All that you are you owe
to me!
You ought be on your knees thanking me,
yet here you stand in judgment!{END}

[Portrait]Dycedarg
[Dialog]You've ruined...everything.

Ivalice was to be...to be ours.


You fools...what have you done?{END}

[Portrait]Adrammelech, the Wroth
[Dialog]So this is what it is to be a god.{END}

Fool of a brother! Heed well these words,
the last your ears shall hear. Slain by my
hand, our father, Barbaneth.
This war had brought our house its chance
to rule. He would but watch as hist'ry
passed us by.
His due I granted him, no more, no less.
No sword yet wrought can parry poison's kiss.{END}

And so on you, <Ramza>, my
gaze alights. Now know regret,
a traitor's recompense!{END}

[Portrait]Adrammelech, the Wroth
[Dialog]Too soon this mortal coil did I assume!

Angel of Blood, High Seraph...come too late...{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]House Beoulve is no more.

But what does it matter?


We are the sum of our deeds,
not our names.{END}

Alma...


I will find you, Alma.{END}
