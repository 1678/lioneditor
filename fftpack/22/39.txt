[Portrait]Argath
[Dialog]We know you're of the Brigade.
There's no use hiding it.
Out with it! What have you done
with the marquis? Where are
you holding him?{END}

You were with your commander,
Wiegraf, when we came upon you.
Where has he gone?{END}

Mayhap a beating would loosen
your tongue!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Enough, Argath!{END}

Hmph.{END}

Listen well.


A great host, with the Order at its van,
prepares a sweeping campaign that will
bring to book your turncloak Brigade.
You will die. You will be hunted down to
the last and slaughtered like the swine you
are, for such is brigandry's reward.
But you, pig, are a lucky one. Tell us what
we wish to know, and you may yet keep
your bacon. So, where is Wiegraf?{END}

[Portrait]Swordsman
[Dialog]How the bloody hell should I know?{END}

I'll not bear your ribald tongue, rogue!
Learn to guard it, if you'd not have it
cut from your throat!{END}

I am no...no rogue.{END}

Tell that to the men you've robbed!{END}

You nobles are...all the same. You think every
man...born outside a castle's walls...less than
human.
We fought for this kingdom at peril of our
very lives. Yet the moment the war was
ended...you turned us out into the streets.
What do you think makes you so special?
Birth? Blood? What difference does it make?{END}

You kidnap men for ransom, then dare
ask the difference between us!?{END}

No... The marquis's kidnapping was...no plan
of Wiegraf's.{END}

...?{END}

He would never...hold a man for ransom.{END}

Then who? Someone kidnapped the
marquis Elmdore de Limberry.{END}

...{END}

Speak! If not you, then on whom
would you pin the deed?{END}

...It was Gustav.{END}

Who is Gustav?{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Gustav Margriff-lieutenant
commander of the Dead Men.{END}

So the Corpse Brigade -was- behind
the kidnapping!{END}

No! We're not like Gustav! We fight
to end the aristocracy, not to
become it!
To be treated as equals-as the
men of honor we are!{END}

What do maggots know of honor?{END}

That's enough, Argath!{END}

So where is this "Gustav"?{END}

In...in the Sand Rat's Sietch.{END}

Sand rat?{END}

You are not of Gallionne-small
wonder you've not heard of them.

Sand rats are unique to the Zeklaus
Desert, north of Dorter.{END}

Do any villages lie between here and
the desert?{END}

Villages? No. At least, not anymore. But
the desertmen once had a settlement on
the outskirts, and its ruins remain.{END}

Then that's where we'll find Gustav and
the marquis.{END}

Aye, like as not.{END}

How can you be so certain?{END}

A "sietch" is a sand rat's burrow-his home.{END}
