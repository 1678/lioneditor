[Dialog]<Ramza>, wait!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]I'm sorry, Alma.{END}

Did you think to leave without so
much as a word?{END}

I...I've never been good at good-byes.{END}

You won't be coming back, will you.{END}

Delita lives, Alma.{END}

What? But how?{END}

He helped them kidnap the princess.{END}

Helped who?{END}

At first I thought it Duke Goltanna-that
Delita had sided with him to spite us.

But now I fear he may be working with
people far more dangerous still.

It is they who wanted to thwart the plot
to assassinate Princess Ovelia.{END}

Is it true that Dycedarg
planned her abduction?{END}

It is.


I am sure he had his reasons, but
I cannot see them for the blood.{END}

Then Tietra-?{END}

-did not share her brother's luck.{END}

Listen to me, Alma.


I know not who guides Delita's actions,
only that they are to be feared.

I know not what evil lies at the end of
this plot.{END}

And Delita serves these people?{END}

I cannot be sure.


I am sure only that Delita has his reasons
as well. If only I could know them.{END}

You mean to fight them, don't you.{END}

...{END}

I'm coming with you.{END}

Are you mad? That's out
of the question!{END}

I want to help you prove the
truth of your words!{END}

No. Not like this.{END}

I would not want my daughter to meet the
same fate Tietra has.{END}

Alma, please...{END}

[Portrait]Man's Voice
[Dialog]<Ramza> Beoulve, if I
am not mistaken.{END}

Ah, but I have you at a disadvantage.
I am Confessor Zalmour Lucianada of
the Holy Office of Inquisition.
I come to bring you before the Office on
charges of the murder of Cardinal Delacroix
and suspicion of heresy.
You will come with us. Should you resist,
you admit your guilt, and will be executed
as a heretic.{END}

If I go with you, I only
prolong my death!{END}

You must run, <Ramza>!
Quickly!{END}

[Portrait]Confessor Zalmour
[Dialog]Then your choice is made!
Put this heretic to the sword!{END}

[Portrait]Confessor Zalmour
[Dialog]Your violence against us is as
violence against the gods!
But it is not too late! Repent of
your sins! Repent, and be spared!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]You name me a heretic, but why?
What have I done?{END}

So you pretend ignorance?


You slew Cardinal Delacroix to gain the
auracite he held and offer it to whatever
hellspawn you profane to call a god!{END}

You could not be more wrong!


The legends of your holy auracite are lies!
The Stones are magicite-they hold in them
power for evil.
The cardinal used this power, and it perverted
him into one of the Lucavi!{END}

Is it not enough that you murdered
Cardinal Delacroix? Must you now
slander his name as well?
More's the pity. You will only see the
name Beoulve washed away in tears.{END}

[Portrait]Alma
[Dialog]Flee, <Ramza>! You must!

Those summoned before the Office
do not return!{END}

I will not flee while you remain, Alma!


I would not see them name you traitor with me!
In staying you risk your own life!{END}

I will not leave you to fight this battle alone!{END}

[Portrait]Confessor Zalmour
[Dialog]Heretics who profane the gods must still face
their justice! You will yet meet yours!{END}
