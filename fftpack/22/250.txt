Forgive me, Wiegraf.{END}

Isilud, wait!{END}

[Dialog]Is this the wonder of the auracite?{END}

Wiegraf!?{END}

Magnificent, the pow'r of the gods!
Nay, not only pow'r-so much more.

Sights unknown I see. My mind a vessel
filled with wisdom of a thousand years.{END}

Ha! You hurry towards your end,
alas too soon.{END}

Such power... Such power!{END}

Elder! What-what are you doing?{END}

[Portrait]Elder Simon
[Dialog]I...I had to bring you this.{END}

A book?{END}

Written by a man named Germonique...one of
Saint Ajora's disciples.

It was lost for a great many years. Only
recently did I discover it among the stacks
of our reliquary beneath the monastery.
It chronicles the true tale of the Zodiac
Braves-no detail is omitted.{END}

Please, Elder, you'll tire yourself.{END}

I am already...so very tired...


I have lived a life of sin. All these years I have
turned a blind eye as the Church rotted with
corruption.
With this book, you can expose their misdeeds!
You can win...Alma's freedom...{END}

Please, Elder!{END}

Ahh. It is done. My mind is now at ease.


The rest, <Ramza>...depends on
you.

You...you really are the very image of
Barbaneth in his youth...you know...{END}

Elder Simon, no!{END}
