[Portrait]Gruff Voice
[Dialog]He disappeared!{END}

[Portrait]Second Voice
[Dialog]Search the eastern hall!{END}

[Portrait]Third Voice
[Dialog]He was injured when he sprung his cell!
He couldn't have run far!{END}

[Portrait]Ovelia
[Dialog]Orran! What's happened!?

You're bleeding!{END}

[Portrait]Orran
[Dialog]Lady Ovelia...there is something...something
I must tell you...{END}

You mustn't speak!{END}

I beg you...hear my words.


The man who murdered Duke Goltanna was
not...not my father, Count Orlandeau.

My father, he...he was framed for treason.
He escaped from Fort Besselat with...
<Ramza> Beoulve.
He fights now to frustrate the High
Confessor's plot.{END}

I did not think the count a man
who would plot at rebellion.{END}

[Portrait]Gruff Voice
[Dialog]The door won't open!{END}

[Portrait]Second Voice
[Dialog]Lady Ovelia! Are you safe?{END}

[Portrait]First Voice
[Dialog]Please open the door, my lady!{END}

But if not your father,
then who?{END}

It-{END}

[Portrait]Southern Sky Knight
[Dialog]Princess, has he harmed you!?{END}

[Portrait]Southern Sky Knight
[Dialog]We found him! He's in here!{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Leave us.{END}

My lord?{END}

Stand up, turn, and walk out
the door behind you!{END}

B-but, Lord Commander-!{END}

It was not a request.{END}

As...as you command, my lord.{END}

I beg you, hurt him no further!{END}

This is a foolish thing you've done, Orran.{END}

Traitor... You have no right
to speak to me.{END}

You act as though you did not wish for
what I did.

Look around you. Do you see any earnest
tears? You were not alone in praying for
his fall.
I even made your father out for dead.
You should thank me. No one pursues
a man known slain.{END}

I am in no mood for japes!{END}

Why would you do such a
thing, Delita?{END}

I told you, didn't I? I work to see
you made a queen for true.{END}

Naught you do is for true! You
wish only to use me like the rest!{END}

You do not trust me?{END}

...{END}

You trust me or you don't, Ovelia.
Which is it?{END}

I...I want to trust you. I do.
But...it is not such an easy thing.{END}

Return to your chambers.
I need have words with Orran.{END}

Please, do not hurt him.{END}

I won't. You have my word.{END}

What I meant to do is done. I only
sought to clear my father's name.

Go on. I only ask you make it
clean and quick.{END}

Stop your whimpering. I do not mean to
kill you. That would be a waste.{END}

What use could you possibly
see in me?{END}

Your loyal service.{END}

Ha! Again you jape!


I would die before I bent my
knee in your service!{END}

No. No, you would not.


I am going to bring down the Northern Sky.
And when that Sky falls, the land of Ivalice
will again be made level.
Then I build a new kingdom for Ovelia.


The High Confessor will face judgment
as well, of course. I am not the Church's
hound.{END}

Are you mad?{END}

You know what I do is right.


It is undeniably so.


A commonborn squire takes the reins
of a knightly order, and leads a wayward
kingdom from the midst of chaos.
The masses yearn for a hero.
I give them what they wish.{END}

Using aught and all to
forge your legend?{END}

Is that so wrong?{END}

What? Do you mean to kill me?{END}

I know full well the High Confessor
sent you to keep watch on me.

Your orders are to kill me at the first
sign of betrayal, no?{END}

Do it, then. Stab me with that dagger.


I stand before you unarmed!
Strike me down!

If you will not, then do not blame me
for this!{END}
