[Portrait]The Baron of Bolmina
[Dialog]This past evenfall, the count stood at twenty
thousand-forty, if both sides be counted.
Alone, we've sustained, ah, two hundred
thousand wounded, as well.{END}

[Portrait]Marquis Elmdore de Limberry
[Dialog]The number of casualties does not concern
me.
Nor does the depletion of our stores-these
were to be expected. No, it is this drought
that threatens us.
The markets are empty and tax collections fall
short. With prices as they are, we can lay in
supplies for another half year, at best.{END}

[Portrait]Viscount Blanche
[Dialog]Duke Larg must surely face like difficulties.

It rained unceasingly in Gallionne this season.
The grain rotted in the fields before it could be
harvested.{END}

[Portrait]Count Cidolfus Orlandeau
[Dialog]The real trouble lies in war's wake. There is
no work. Whole villages have been displaced.
Orran tells me over one hundred thousand
have already fled to Lesalia, and more pour
in by the day.{END}

[Portrait]Viscount Blanche
[Dialog]Ha! I see no trouble in this! Let Larg struggle
to feed the mewling maids and his soldiers both!{END}

[Portrait]Count Cidolfus Orlandeau
[Dialog]It is no laughing matter! Should the conflict
spread, we may find ourselves no better off.    
Think you Zeltennia proof against such fate?
I assure you, we are not!

Has not the time come to chart a course to
peace?{END}

[Portrait]Duke Goltanna
[Dialog]Your fears are well founded. But we cannot
yet end this war.
We shall treble the rate of tax, and keep a
close watch on those who hope to profiteer
in these trying times.
As for those seeking refuge outside the castle
walls, we shall tighten our patrols at the
Limberry border to see they are turned back.{END}

[Portrait]Count Cidolfus Orlandeau
[Dialog]Duke Larg suffers, as do we. What better
time to treat for peace?{END}

[Portrait]Duke Goltanna
[Dialog]You talk in circles, Orlandeau. There can be no
peaceful end to this.{END}

[Portrait]Count Cidolfus Orlandeau
[Dialog]The kingdom cannot exist without her people,
Excellency! No more than can we.
In the Fifty Years' War, who bore a greater
burden than they? Would you thank them now
with higher taxes?
And it is not only the people. Our soldiers
are made to fight on rations that would
scarce feed a child at his mother's skirts.
We cannot long sustain this war. It is a
matter of resources and resolve.{END}

[Portrait]Duke Goltanna
[Dialog]Resolve? Have you any? These are the words
of a coward.{END}

[Portrait]Count Cidolfus Orlandeau
[Dialog]The Fifty Years' War was fought to drive
back an invasion of our sovereign soil.
We were honorbound to fight!{END}

[Portrait]Duke Goltanna
[Dialog]And in -this- war you do not feel so bound?

You were never one given to hypocrisy,
Orlandeau.

Show leniency now, and they will only strike
the harder. This fight is not only for ourselves,
but for our people in equal measure.
The Crown cumbers them with its every act.
We fight to free them of such tyrannies.{END}

[Portrait]Viscount Blanche
[Dialog]His Grace has the right of it. Besides, why lay
down the sword with victory so near?
Your title is ill earned, "Thunder God" Cid.
Your gentle words would sooner stir a breeze.{END}

[Portrait]Count Cidolfus Orlandeau
[Dialog]Is victory so near? My ears are deaf to
its approach.
What see you in our plight that portends
victory? Or have you forsworn the use
of your eyes?{END}

[Portrait]Viscount Blanche
[Dialog]I will not sit here and tolerate such insults!{END}

[Portrait]Duke Goltanna
[Dialog]Enough of this!

You disappoint me, Orlandeau.
Pray you do not disappoint me
further.{END}

[Portrait]Count Cidolfus Orlandeau
[Dialog]...{END}

[Portrait]Duke Goltanna
[Dialog]I will say this but once.

Any man who cares not for the course I've
chosen had best remove himself now. I will
brook no further doubt, Orlandeau!{END}
