[Portrait]Northern Sky Knight
[Dialog]Stand aside, ser! You are defeated!

Surrender the princess, and no more
blood must needs be spilt!{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]Do you so enjoy the taste of lies? Your
orders are to see the princess dead!
And once I've watched you feed the
falls her blood, I'm to believe you'd
let me live, a witness to your crime?{END}

What foolishness is this? We came to
save the princess, not kill her!

What could we possibly gain by Lady
Ovelia's death? We wish only to see
her freed from the Black Lion's claws!{END}

[Portrait]Agrias
[Dialog]Your Highness!{END}

[Portrait]Ovelia
[Dialog]Agrias!{END}

Hmm. It seems we are no longer alone.
Gaffgarion! Kill them all!{END}

A change of plans...but a contract is a
contract, after all!{END}

You would now betray us!?{END}

Betray you? You have a viper's tongue,
milady. I betray no one.

I am in the Order's employ, and they are
of it. My task was to see the princess
safely abducted.
And theirs, to see the one responsible
silenced.{END}

You mean to say the kidnapping was
a ruse?{END}

The princess is an obstacle to the throne.


So long as she lives, the threat remains that
someone could assert her claim above Prince
Orinus's. Two heirs are one too many!{END}

If her death is certain, then let it least not
be in vain.

Kill her if you must, but let it be held she
was taken by Goltanna's men.

Do that, and the stroke that fells a problem
princess at once brings down a rival Lion.
That was no doubt Larg's plan all along.
...Or was it his? Such a plot has more the
feel of Dycedarg's thinking.

Would you not agree, <Ramza>?{END}

That one has the right of it,
<Ramza>.

Come, let us earn our pay!{END}

No...not again. I will not watch as
sacrifices are made of the weak
and innocent.
She will not be another Tietra!{END}

[Portrait]Agrias
[Dialog]Hold on, Your Highness!
I am coming to help!{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]Do not be so sure of that!{END}

Have you any idea what you do?
The path you tread leads only
to perdition!
An adopted daughter she may be,
but a daughter of kings no less!
To lay a finger on her is treason!{END}

Of that, I am well aware. But
your daughter of kings stands
in the way of kings-to-be!
Princess or no, her worth is
spent. And those born of kings
do not outlive their worth.{END}

Do you mean to mock her!?{END}

No more than we are mocked. Have you
once seen a man of royal blood stay his
hand when a commoner blocked his way?
The only difference is that those of royal
blood are protected by lackwits like you, who
swear fealty without even a thought!
Even should the princess live, it would be
only as a pawn in another's game. To kill
her now is a mercy!{END}

Then it is a mercy I will not see
her done!{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Delita! You live!{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]So I do. And you, ever your lord
brothers' faithful hound?{END}

Are you mad? I knew naught
of any of this!

What of you, Delita? You now
play party to their plot?{END}

Surely you jape! I came to rescue
the princess!

I would not see her made a tool
for others to use to their own ends!{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]If you would lie, boy, at least lie well!
You are no knight errant!
You were paid to take the princess.
Do not play the fool with me! Name
the man who bought your sword!{END}

I sell my sword to no one! Do
not count me among your lot!{END}

Spare me the lecture, I ask for a name!


You'd have me believe some bright-eyed
pup caught wind of this plan and rescued
the princess in the name of justice!?
Who gives you your orders? Who told you
of this plot!?{END}

That is not for you to know!{END}

[Portrait]Princess Ovelia
[Dialog]Tell me, ser-are you friend or foe?{END}

[Portrait]Delita
[Dialog]I am a human being, no different
from you.{END}

[Portrait]Ovelia
[Dialog]D-deliver me...O Lord...{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]No!
{END}

[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]You knew of this from the start! How could
you dirty your hands with such tainted coin?{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]Dirty? A man cannot sell his blade
and think to keep it clean!
I do what I am paid to do, and
question not the details! That is
the way of a sellsword.{END}

Why did you not tell me!?{END}

What would you have done if I had?
Stopped me?

The job would have been done,
by our hands or no! It makes
no difference in the end!
Lives end every day with you none
the wiser. You cannot save them
all!
Or are you so foolish as to believe
you can?{END}

But...but this isn't right!{END}

What of it?


You are still a child-a child
who will not see the world
for what it is.
A man does not turn his eyes
from truth. A man accepts it,
and walks the path he must.
Do not chide me, when you
cannot even choose a path
for yourself!{END}

[Portrait]Gaffgarion
[Dialog]Damn it...{END}
