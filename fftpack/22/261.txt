[Portrait]<Ramza>
[Dialog]Father... What would you have done?{END}

Is that...?{END}

[Portrait]Orran
[Dialog]We meet again.{END}

I see the Black Lion sits upon your
breast. You are of the Order of the
Southern Sky, then?{END}

I am. And it would seem we have you
to thank for dealing with our deserters.

Ha! I must admit, I'd never thought
I'd see the day a Beoulve lent his aid
to -our- order!{END}

The fight was not of my choosing.{END}

I know. You do not wish to shed blood,
but it cannot always be avoided.

We're no different. Do you think we hunt
these men down out of enmity? Craven
they may be, but they've not wronged us.{END}

You knew who I was all along, didn't you?{END}

I did. I'd seen your name and face upon
a bill.

Inexpiable heresy, was it not? My mind
reels at the thought of what you must
have done!{END}

Have you a mind to turn me in?{END}

Why would I do that?


Our orders are to capture deserters.
They say nothing of heretics already
hunted mercilessly by their own.
If I were one of those, I think I'd get
moving before the lions at my heels
thought to feast upon me as well.{END}

Why do you still fight?{END}

So long as your brothers point their
swords at our throats, we must.{END}

If the White Lion lowered his claws,
the Black would follow suit?{END}

No, I do not think it like he would.{END}

Could you deliver a message to Count
Orlandeau, if you should chance to
meet him?
There are men behind the curtain who
goad the dukes for their own gain.

We are all but puppets, dancing as they
pull our strings. It is those men we
ought be fighting.{END}

I can deliver the message. But why to the
count?{END}

My father once told me Count Orlandeau
was the only man he could truly call friend.{END}

I am the count's adopted son. I will tell him
what you've told me.{END}

Then you believe me?{END}

I do not know the reason these men seek
the Zodiac Stones.

If it is for the benefit of the people, I see
no reason to raise protest.

But if they seek to use the legend for
their own gain, I can assure you my
stepfather will not sit idly by.
It was not for quiet complacence he was
given the name of "Thunder God."{END}

You know of the High Confessor's plot?{END}

Of it, yes. But we have no hard evidence.


Our spies are working tirelessly, but I
suspect you know more than they.{END}

If you did have evidence of the plot,
would you then be willing to lay down
your swords?{END}

Such evidence exists?{END}

The Scriptures-no, it matters not.
I simply wish to know.{END}

Whether or not it would mean the end of
this conflict, I cannot say.

But my father, for one, would surely
sheathe his blade.{END}

[Portrait]Southern Sky Knight
[Dialog]Lord Orran! We must press onward!{END}

Very well. Let us resume our march!{END}

Farewell, <Ramza>. See that
you keep your head about your
shoulders.{END}

Never think yourself without allies!


You -do- have friends-friends who
would gladly lay down their lives
fighting beside you!
And I count myself among them!{END}

Thank you, Orran.{END}
