[Portrait]Master Darlavon
[Dialog]Now then, let us begin the lesson.

In this session, we shall discuss status effects.


Status effects are indicated by a variety of
cues, such as the color of a unit or a balloon
above the unit's head.{END}

You may see all status effects currently
affecting a unit by looking at his or her status
screen.{END}

A status effect refers to a variety of
conditions that may affect a unit on the
battlefield.
In general, these may be divided into four
groups: beneficial statuses, status ailments,
physical states, and action states.
Firstly, let us discuss the various action states
a unit may be in as a result of using abilities.{END}

There are 3 different action states: charging,
performing, and defending.

These states are generally canceled once the
unit's next turn arrives, or when an ability
goes into effect.{END}

The magick has been cast, so the black mage's
charging state has now been canceled.

Next, I shall explain beneficial statuses.


A beneficial status is a positive effect that is
brought about by an ability or spell.

These may gradually restore the unit's HP,
or increase the unit's Speed attribute.{END}

For example, the Protect magick increases a
unit's resistance to physical attacks.

Thus, the affected unit will take less damage
from physical attacks.

There are many other beneficial statuses.


Beneficial statuses may be removed by means
of the mystic's Harmony ability.{END}

Next, we shall discuss status ailments.


These negative statuses include curses or
magick effects that adversely affect a unit.

These may cause the unit to act randomly,
be unable to move or act, or have its HP
gradually drained.{END}

One example of this is the Blind status.
When blinded, a unit's chance of striking a
blow in combat is decreased.
There are many other types of status
ailments.{END}

If the effect of a status ailment is adversely
affecting a unit's performance in battle, it is
best to remove it.
Status ailments may be removed by using a
remedy, or with the white magick Esuna.{END}

However, these may not be effective against
all status ailments.

There are additional ways of removing status
ailments as well.

For example, a unit who has been turned to
stone may also be restored by using a
gold needle.
However, a unit who has been turned undead
may only be restored by using holy water.

For more information about how to remove
status effects, refer to the quick help
descriptions.{END}

Lastly, allow me to explain about physical
states.

There are two physical states: Critical and
KO.{END}

A critically wounded unit may have his or
her HP restored with the white magick Cure
or with a potion.
A KO'd unit may be revived with the white
magick Raise or with phoenix down.{END}

The Critical state has no particular adverse
effects on a unit, but a KO'd unit cannot
act on his or her own.
Prepare in advance to keep your units from
being KO'd.

It is always advisable to bring at least one
unit with abilities that allow it to heal or
revive other units.
If you do not revive a KO'd unit within a
certain amount of time, its body will
disappear.
In its place, a treasure chest or crystal will
appear.

Once a unit has disappeared in this way,
reviving him or her will be impossible.
The unit is gone forever.
Crystals and treasure chests left behind
by KO'd units may be obtained by moving
units onto the tiles they occupy.
Treasure chests contain items.


Crystals restore a unit's HP and MP.


In some cases, crystals allow the units that
obtain them to acquire the abilities of
the units who left them behind.
The units will instantly learn the new
abilities without having to spend job
points.{END}

This concludes my discussion of status
effects.

Always do your best to use items and
white magicks to prevent your units from
being KO'd.
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.{END}
