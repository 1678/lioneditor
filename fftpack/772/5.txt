[spazio]Several other knights apprentice and I, all of us soon to
graduate into the ranks of knighthood, were called to
gather at the Akademy Hall. An unsavory band of outlaws
known as the Corpse Brigade continues to plunder and loot
throughout Gallionne, and plans are afoot for the Order to
rid the land of these ne'er-do-wells. We knights apprentice
are charged with providing rear-guard support. (Press [Triangolo]

[spazio]That night, I dreamt of things long past. My lord
father, Barbaneth Beoulve, former commander of the
Order of the Northern Sky and renowned hero of the
Fifty Years' War, had been bedridden for some two years.
As he lay upon his deathbed, he was but a pale shadow of
the man who had once led countless legions into battle. I
stood at his bedside with my lord brothers and young
sister, awaiting the end. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]We rescued a swordsman under attack by the Corpse
Brigade on Mandalia Plain. His name was Argath, a knight
apprentice in the household of Marquis Elmdore de
Limberry. It seemed their carriage was waylaid en route
to Eagrose. The marquis was abducted in the attack, and
all among his guard were killed, save Argath. Argath
pleaded for the Northern Order's aid in rescuing the
marquis. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]We had found our way to Eagrose, the high seat of
Gallionne, and immediately made for the castle, where my
lord brother Dycedarg awaited our arrival. In his haste to
avenge the deaths of his fellows, Argath pleaded fervently
to be granted a troop of soldiers, for which my lord
brother roundly rebuked him. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Following our audience with my lord brother Dycedarg,
we chanced upon Zalbaag and Alma in the gardens. Before
leaving to attend to his duties, Zalbaag confided that a
spy in his employ had recently disappeared in the vicinity
of the merchant city of Dorter. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]We combed the slums of Dorter and turned up the 
Corpse Brigade, with their leader Wiegraf among their
ranks. After setting them to rout, we interrogated one of
our prisoners on the marquis's whereabouts. The brigand
confessed to the abduction, but said it was the work of
the Corpse Brigade's second-in-command, Gustav
Margriff, who desired a ransom. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]After a successful raid of the so-called Sand Rat's
Sietch, we entered the ramshackle building in which
Marquis Elmdore was confined. An unexpected sight
greeted us there: it was Wiegraf, berating Gustav for
abducting the marquis. Words soon turned to swords, and
Gustav was slain. Wiegraf left the marquis and fled into
the darkness. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]No warm words of commendation for our rescue of the
marquis awaited us upon our return to Eagrose Castle.
Instead, my lord brother Dycedarg fumed over our
violation of orders, asking if I intended to live up to our
family name or befoul it. At that moment, Duke Larg,
liege lord of Gallionne and trueborn brother to the queen,
made his entrance. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]The plan to rid the realm of the Corpse Brigade was in
its final stages. We raided one of their dens at the
southernmost tip of Gallionne, and it was there we met
Milleuda. A member of the Corpse Brigade and younger
sister to its leader, Wiegraf Folles, Milleuda seems to
hold a deep resentment for the aristocracy and the Crown.
(Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Our manse at Eagrose was plundered by the Corpse
Brigade. The campaign to rid Gallionne of the criminals
had left too few soldiers on guard. The attackers' goal was
the assassination of Dycedarg, retainer to Duke Larg.
But although they succeeded in storming the manse, their
murderous plot was foiled by Zalbaag. As they fled, they
took Delita's young sister Tietra as a hostage. (Press [Triangolo]
to view.) {END}

[spazio]Dycedarg, injured during the Corpse Brigade's assault,
informed me that the Brigade was already in shambles,
and that Zalbaag was preparing for a full-scale attack to
finish them off. He promised me, however, that this
attack would not be carried out until Tietra was brought
back to safety. Argath bluntly asserted that delaying the
attack to save the life of a "common maid" would be
foolish, enraging Delita. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]On our way to Ziekden, Delita and I came upon a small
meadow, painted a golden hue by the setting sun. As we
gazed in awe at the natural beauty all around us, Delita
began to question his lot in life. Unable to provide him
with the answers he sought, I stood silent and powerless.
Delita then pressed a blade of grass to his lips and began
to whistle-a trick my lord father once taught us as
children. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Gragoroth and Wiegraf had yet eluded the Order's
pursuit, finding refuge in one of the mills that dot the
Fovoham windflats. Wiegraf vehemently condemned
Gragoroth for kidnapping Tietra. When a scout arrived
with word of Milleuda's death, Wiegraf, consumed with
grief and hatred, vowed to quench his blade with the blood
of Milleuda's killers. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Snow dusted Ziekden Fortress as stragglers from the
Corpse Brigade took refuge within, but the Northern Sky
held firm its position around the perimeter. Argath slew
Gragoroth after first shooting Tietra, whom Gragoroth
was using as a human shield. Delita, enraged by the death
of his sister, saw Argath repaid in kind. The gunpowder
planted by Gragoroth was then set alight, reducing the
fortress to rubble. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]A year had passed since the tragedy at Ziekden. The
Dukes Larg and Goltanna had been locked in a fierce
political struggle for control of Ivalice since the king's
death. Tensions were high, and war seemed all but
inevitable. Secret plans were under way to bring Princess
Ovelia from Orbonne Monastery to Gallionne to prevent
the outbreak of war. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Lady Agrias set out in heavy rain in search of
Princess Ovelia, who had been kidnapped by men bearing
the standard of Duke Goltanna. I decided to join her in
the search, as my dear friend Delita, whom I believed to
have died at Ziekden, had been among the Black Lion's
men. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]After abducting Princess Ovelia, Delita found himself
under attack by the Northern Sky at Zeirchele Falls. It
there came to light that Duke Larg had ordered the
kidnapping, his goals twofold: to force Duke Goltanna
from power by destroying his name, and to kill Ovelia,
eliminating the threat of her claim to the throne. Upon
discovering that Gaffgarion knew of all this, I broke with
him in support of the princess. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]In Zaland, we met a young man named Mustadio, who
was being pursued by thugs in the employ of the Baert
Trading Company. Mustadio was a machinist from Goug,
determined to revive lost technologies such as the pistol.
The young man was worried about his captured father, and
refused to tell us why he was being chased. As he was
seeking Cardinal Delacroix for sanctuary, Mustadio asked
to accompany us to Lionel Castle. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]We stopped for a brief respite on our journey to Lionel
Castle. The princess spoke candidly of her childhood with
Agrias. She also spoke of her distrust for those in
power-those who sought to use her for political gain.
If only I had words to console the princess in her time of
need. In hopes of lightening her spirit, I showed her the
way to whistle using a blade of grass. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]Dycedarg's initial plan to kidnap Ovelia foiled, he once
again ordered Gaffgarion into action. But this time, he
authorized the death of any who dared to interfere-even
I, his own brother, was to be no exception. The incident
at Orbonne Monastery had alerted Dycedarg to the
existence of another player in this game of thrones-one
dead set on foiling his plans. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Cardinal Delacroix greeted us warmly at the keep of
Lionel Castle, and pledged to send word of Duke Larg's
plot to the High Confessor at once. The cardinal also
showed us one of the Zodiac Stones spoken of in ancient
Ivalician legend. It came to light that Mustadio's troubles
were also connected to the Stones, and so we set out for
Goug while the princess and Lady Agrias remained at the
castle. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]The crystal that had been unearthed deep beneath the
city of Goug was in fact one of the legendary Zodiac
Stones. Fearing the Stone would fall into the wrong hands,
Mustadio's father Besrudio entrusted it to his son and
beseeched him to hide it someplace safe. But just as
Mustadio took the Stone, thugs in the employ of the Baert
Trading Company arrived to give chase. (Press [Triangolo] to
view.) {END}

[spazio]Cardinal Delacroix had been behind it all, using the
Baert Trading Company as a front to obtain the Zodiac
Stone found in Goug for himself. Mustadio's quick thinking
prevented the enemy from obtaining the real Stone, and
saved his father's life in the process. But the princess and
Lady Agrias were still in the cardinal's clutches. I made
for Lionel Castle straight away, Stone in hand, to rescue
them. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Once again I crossed paths with Delita-this time in
the port city of Warjilis. He advised me not to concern
myself any further with the princess or the Zodiac
Stones, suggesting that some great and powerful will was
fanning the flames of this conflict. The words he spoke
weighed upon my mind: "Noble endeavors do not always
reach the end that we desire." (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Dycedarg and the cardinal, it seems, had made a secret
pact in order to obtain both the Stone and the princess.
Gaffgarion was dispatched to the cardinal by Dycedarg,
and suggested that Princess Ovelia be used as bait to
obtain the Stone, and to lure all those who knew of the
kidnapping to their deaths. As for Ludovich Baert, the
cardinal personally saw that he received stiff punishment
for failing in his duties. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Delita visited the room in Lionel Castle to which Ovelia
was confined. After she accused him of collaborating with
Cardinal Delacroix, the cardinal himself entered the room
with a man who appeared to be a knight. After Ovelia
refused to cooperate with them, the mysterious man
informed her of the shocking truth behind her heritage.
(Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Delita brought Ovelia to a castle in Zeltennia where
Duke Goltanna awaited them. After framing one of the
duke's retainers as the mastermind behind Ovelia's
kidnapping, Delita suggested that Duke Goltanna himself
lead the Order of the Southern Sky to march on Lesalia.
Duke Larg then mobilized the Order of the Northern Sky
in response, dividing Ivalice into two factions. The War of
the Lions had begun. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Three months had passed since the beginning of the
War of the Lions. The conflict grew fiercer by the day,
and the forces of Dukes Larg and Goltanna grew
increasingly weary of the endless battle. Pleading for the
overtaxed and starving populace, Count Orlandeau, lord
commander of the Order of the Southern Sky, proposed
peace talks to Duke Goltanna. However, his suggestion did
not fall upon sympathetic ears. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]While en route to Lesalia, we rescued a young astrologer
from an assault by brigands in the mining town of Gollund.
His name was Orran Durai, and he reacted strangely upon
hearing the name Beoulve. He respectfully declined the
offer to join us on our journey, hinting that we would be
like to cross paths again. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]We met my brother Zalbaag in Lesalia, where I informed
him that there was a presence working in secret to stoke
the war's flames. But Zalbaag paid no heed to my words
and saw fit to admonish me instead, appalled that I would
accuse our lord brother Dycedarg of kidnapping the
princess. We then received word that Count Orlandeau,
lord commander of the Order of the Southern Sky, had
broken through at Dugeura Pass. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]I was branded a heretic by Confessor Zalmour, but
managed to stave him off at the postern of Lesalia
Castle. This did little to assuage my suspicions about the
Church of Glabados. Alma informed me that one of the
Stones, Virgo, was kept within Orbonne Monastery. As a
heretic, entering the monastery alone would be an
impossibility. I had no other choice but to have Alma
accompany me. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]By the time we arrived, men had already forced their
way into the monastery in search of its Stone. We found
Elder Simon in dire condition, collapsed in the vaults. He
revealed that High Confessor Marcel plotted to use the
chaos of this war to gather the Stones and revive the
legend of the Zodiac Braves. I asked Alma to stay with
the elder, entrusting her with the Stones I carried, and
went in search of the attackers. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]The Knights Templar made off with the Virgo Stone,
and Alma as well. Wiegraf, who had joined the templarate
in a bid for power, lay near death outside. In desperation
he bound himself in an infernal contract with the Aries
Stone, allowing the transmigration of a Lucavi, Belias,
into his body, then vanished from sight. Elder Simon placed
the Scriptures of Germonique in my hands, then passed
into the Father's keeping. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]By the will of Duke Goltanna, Ovelia was enthroned as
queen at Zeltennia Castle. But discovering the truth of
her origins had wounded her deeply. Delita came to console
the new queen, offering to build her a new kingdom, and
promising her a life where she would have no more need of
tears. These comforting words in her time of despair
helped Ovelia to start building a bond of trust with Delita.

[spazio]Orran and I crossed paths once again in the rain-sodden
Grogh Heights. I discovered that he was the adopted son
of Count Orlandeau, lord commander of the Order of the
Southern Sky. Orran, too, was aware of the High
Confessor's search for the Stones, and his scheme to
foment discontent on both sides of the conflict. (Press

[spazio]After rescuing a young girl named Rapha in Yardrow, I
was told of Grand Duke Barrington, liege lord of Fovoham,
and his sinister plot to use the chaos of war to obtain the
throne of Ivalice for himself. The girl's brother Marach,
however, remained loyal to the grand duke, and threatened
to take Alma's life unless we both went to Riovanes.
(Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Grand Duke Barrington had invited knights of the
templarate to Riovanes in hopes of striking a deal with
them. The grand duke had seized the Taurus and Scorpio
Stones from Ser Isilud, and was attempting to use them-
along with his knowledge of the location of the Scriptures
of Germonique-to acquire the full backing of the Church.
However, Lord Folmarv refused to comply, angered by the
grand duke's presumption. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Alma sat alone in the dungeon of Riovanes Castle, no
doubt wondering when I would come to rescue her. The
dungeon's eerie quiet was shattered suddenly by a shriek
of pain. Alma staggered backwards as a Riovanesian knight
fell before her and, after a few fearful words, breathed
his last. Alma prayed for his soul's repose and then padded
cautiously through the open door. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]In shock from the horror of the events that had
unfolded, Alma discovered Knight Templar Isilud in the
grand duke's parlor. He entrusted her with the Pisces
Stone before falling into an eternal sleep. Lord Folmarv
then appeared, but as he approached Alma, the Virgo Stone
began to shine brightly. Intrigued, he took the struggling
Alma away with him. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Marach had taken Grand Duke Barrington's bullet to
save his sister's life. As a tearful Rapha cradled his body,
the Scorpio Stone upon her chest began to glow. At this,
I recalled the horrible episode of transmigration with
Wiegraf, and a dreadful feeling consumed my thoughts-
that a Lucavi might appear at any moment. But no demon
was summoned by the Stone's light. Instead, Marach's soul
was restored to him. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]I searched desperately for Alma, but she was nowhere
to be found at Riovanes. All that remained in the castle's
ravaged parlor was the Pisces Stone. Marach remarked
that the Stone's power depended on the nature of its user,
but as I clasped the Stone tightly in my hands, all I could
think of was Alma. The war had begun to take a new
direction, and chaos flared throughout Ivalice. (Press [Triangolo]
to view.) {END}

[spazio]While grasping for clues as to Alma's whereabouts,
Marach mentioned the name of Lord Folmarv, lord
commander of the Knights Templar. It seemed that even
High Confessor Marcel and his vile ambitions were being
used by him. In order to uncover the truth about Lord
Folmarv and his aims, I thought it wise to visit my former
friend and confidant Delita in Zeltennia. (Press [Triangolo] to

[spazio]Orran welcomed Count Orlandeau back to Zeltennia
Castle, whereupon the young astrologer reported to him
the peculiar string of events happening throughout Ivalice,
all revolving around the Stones. He then spoke candidly of
the Church and the Knights Templar, and their suspicious
tendencies of late. Count Orlandeau pulled the Libra Stone
from his pocket and gazed into it, overcome by foreboding
at the battle that must soon come. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]I met Delita at a church in Zeltennia. He informed me
of the High Confessor's plan to assassinate both Duke
Larg and Duke Goltanna in a bid to give the Church
absolute power over the realm. I inquired of Delita's true
intentions. It was then that he denied his loyalty to the
Church, and expressed his feelings for Ovelia. (Press [Triangolo]

[spazio]A woman approached Delita and I after we had defeated
Confessor Zalmour. Her name was Valmafra, a young mage
dispatched by the Church along with Delita. She informed
us that the Order of the Northern Sky had begun its
advance on Fort Besselat. I immediately started out for
Besselat to meet with Count Orlandeau, for this was my
only hope of preventing a major clash of the Orders.
(Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Upon his arrival at Fort Besselat, Count Orlandeau
was accused of plotting rebellion against Duke Goltanna.
Although the count maintained his innocence, the duke,
fully unaware of the High Confessor's scheme, ordered
him imprisoned. Soon after this surprising turn of events,
Delita was dubbed a Knight Devout by Duke Goltanna and
made lord commander of the Order of the Southern Sky.
(Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]The foul poison dispersed by Ser Barich of the Knights
Templar brought the Order of the Northern Sky to its
knees. Even Lord Dycedarg and Duke Larg succumbed to
its vile effects. Zalbaag rushed to their rescue, only to
witness Dycedarg stab their duke in cold blood. Zalbaag
stood in a state of shock and disbelief as Dycedarg spoke
of his ambition that Ivalice be brought under total reign
of House Beoulve. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Opening the floodgates at Fort Besselat prevented a
disastrous clash of the Orders. Count Orlandeau,
disillusioned by his liege lord's warmongering, decided to
accompany us in hopes of putting an end to the High
Confessor's ambitions. The count's adopted son Orran
