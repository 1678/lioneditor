[spazio]Twelve constellations illuminate the evening sky,
moving along the same elliptical path traveled by the sun
and the moon. These constellations correspond to the
twelve signs of the zodiac, each of which takes a turn
dominating the nights of Ivalice for one month each year.
These months, named for their respective zodiac signs,
correspond to those of the solar calendar as follows.

[spazio]It is the destiny of all creatures to be born under a
particular sign of the zodiac. The interactions of man
and monster alike are governed by the compatibilities of
these signs. When the twelve are arranged in a circle, and
straight lines drawn to form squares between them, signs
at the corners of a given square's corners are of poor
compatibility.

[spazio]Here are examples of signs with poor compatibility:

[spazio]When lines of equal length are drawn to form a triangle,
signs at the triangle's points are of good compatibility.

[spazio]Gender also plays a significant role in determining
compatibility. Units with opposite signs and the same
gender have the poorest possible compatibility. Units with
opposite signs and opposite genders, however, have
excellent compatibility. Monsters are considered to be of
opposite gender to both male and female humans, but the
same gender as other monsters.

[spazio]Here is an illustration of compatibility extremes.

[spazio]Compatibility affects both the amount of damage dealt
to enemies and the success rate of magicks. For example,
if a unit attacks an enemy of good compatibility with a
weapon, it will deal 1/4 more damage than it normally
would. Excellent compatibility would increase the amount
of damage by 1/2. On the other hand, damage dealt to
enemies of poor compatibility is reduced by 1/4, and of
extremely poor compatibility, by 1/2.{END}

[spazio]Monsters are considered opposite in gender to both male
and female human units, but the same gender as other
monsters.{END}

[spazio]Charge time (CT) determines the order of units' turns
in battle. When a unit's CT reaches 100, that unit
receives a turn to move and act. A unit's CT is increased
by an amount equal to its Speed with each tick of the
game clock, so units with higher Speed will receive turns
more frequently.


[spazio]Weapon attacks are carried out immediately upon
selecting "Attack," but magicks and some other abilities
take additional time to execute. A separate CT counter
starts for these abilities as soon as the unit completes
its turn. Once the count reaches 100, the magick or
ability will take effect. A magick's CT is increased by
amounts equal to the Speed of the magick itself.
{END}

[spazio]You will likely wish to keep a close eye on the order of
units' turns during battle. There are several different
ways to do so.





1. When the cursor is on a unit, that unit's order in the
Brotation is shown just above its various attributes
Bin the lower left of the screen.
2. When selecting an ability to perform, pressing the left
Bor right button will open a turn list showing when that
Bability would take effect relative to other units'
Bactions.

3. To view the current turn list, close any open menus,
Bpress [Triangolo], and then select "Turn List" from the menu
Bthat appears. You can check the location of any unit
Bon the list by moving the cursor to its number in the
Bturn list and then pressing [Croce].



4. You can sort units according to turn order in the unit
Blist. To open the unit list, close any open menus, press
B[Triangolo], and then select "Unit List" from the menu that
Bappears.
5. Pressing START when no menus are displayed will cycle
Bthrough all units in order of their turn numbers.{END}

[spazio]When selecting magicks, which have a charge time
requirement, you will see three different columns. The
name of the magick is listed under the Ability column.
The MP column shows the magick's MP cost. The turn on
which the unit would finish casting the magick is
indicated by the number in the Turn column. If a magick
can be reflected, a curved arrow icon will be shown to the
left of the MP cost.
[spazio]The number shown in the Turn column depends on when
the magick is cast. If only one other unit would receive a
turn before the magick takes effect, the number in this
column would be a 2. If two units would have a chance to
act, this number would be a 3. To see when in the turn
list a magick would be cast, move the cursor to that
magick's name and press the left or right button.{END}

[spazio]When selecting a target for a unit's action, the red
tiles displayed around the unit are the tiles that may be
targeted. You can view the effective range of weapons or
abilities in their help messages. Most weapons have a
range of 1, but some have greater reach. For example,
polearms have a range of 2, and crossbows of 4.


[spazio]When an ability's help text shows a range of Self, that
particular ability may only be executed on the unit's own
tile. The ranges of some actions are limited vertically as
well. If this is the case, a vertical range limit will also
be listed as "Vert." followed by a number. A vertical range
of 2 means the action can target a tile of up to 2 units
of elevation above or below the current one.
{END}

[spazio]The radius of an ability or weapon is the measure of
how many tiles it may affect. For example, the white
magick Cure has a radius of 2. Thus, it will affect the
target tile, as well as the next four neighboring tiles.
These tiles are highlighted in green once a target is
selected.


[spazio]The radius for weapons is always 1. Abilities, on the
other hand, have various radiuses, which may be checked
using the help system. If the radius shown in the help
window has a vertical limit, it will be denoted by "Vert."
followed by a number. If the vertical radius is 1, then it
may reach 1 tile above or below the targeted tile.


[spazio]Some abilities do not affect every tile within their
radius of effect, but instead hit only a random number of
tiles. Being within an ability's radius does not guarantee
a unit will be affected.{END}

[spazio]During a unit's turn, it may move once and perform a
single action. Always consider the range of units'
abilities before moving them. Otherwise, units may find
themselves unable to reach the desired targets when
casting magicks or performing other actions. Once a
unit's movement has been confirmed, that movement
cannot be canceled.{END}

[spazio]The predicted results of an action are displayed at the
bottom of the screen when selecting a target. The
estimated amount of damage or recovery is shown, along
with the chance of success. If the ability in question has
a chance of inflicting or removing a status effect, the
name of the effect and percentage chance of infliction
or removal will be shown. If multiple status effects are
involved, only one of them will be displayed. 
[spazio]The target's Block Rates (C-EV, S-EV, and A-EV)
are factored into the percentage chance of success. For
physical attacks, the target's chance of blocking with a
weapon is also considered if that unit has been assigned
the Parry ability. However, Block Rates are not the only
factors involved. Abilities that add or remove status
effects have their own inherent chances of success.

[spazio]When the targeted unit has been assigned a reaction
ability, the name of that ability is also displayed under
that unit's status information.{END}

[spazio]When using an ability with a charge time requirement,
such as a magick, you must decide whether to target a
specific unit or a tile. If a unit is targeted, that unit
will remain targeted even if it moves to another tile. The
area of effect moves with the unit. If a tile is targeted,
the effect will remain centered on that tile and may miss
the intended target or targets if they move away.{END}

[spazio]Arithmeticians can cast magicks targeting all units
whose attributes fit a particular arithmetick expression.
The following rules apply to the Arithmeticks ability:

1. To use Arithmeticks, a unit must know the abilities
Bfor at least one base attribute (CT, Level, EXP, or
BHeight) and one algorithm (Multiple of 5, Multiple of 4,
BMultiple of 3, or Prime).
2. Targets are determined by the selected attribute and
Balgorithm.
3. Arithmeticks may be used to cast white, black, and time
Bmagicks, and may also be used with the mystic arts.
4. Magicks cast with Arithmeticks require no charge
Btime.
5. Magicks cast with Arithmeticks consume no MP.
6. Magicks cast with Arithmeticks cannot be reflected.
[spazio]As an example, you could select Level for the base
attribute, Multiple of 5 for the algorithm, and the black
magick Fire as the effect to cast Level 5 Fire. All units
whose levels are multiples of 5 will be hit with Fire.




[spazio]There are four different algorithms: Multiple of 3,
Multiple of 4, Multiple of 5, and Prime. The first three
target units whose target attribute is a multiple of that
number. For example, the algorithm Multiple of 3 targets
all units with values of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and so on for
the selected attribute. Prime, on the other hand, targets
all units with a prime number as the value of the selected
attribute.
[spazio]A prime number is a number higher than 1 that can
only be evenly divided by 1 and itself. These are the
prime numbers less than 100:

l   2    3    5    7  11  13  17
l 19  23  29  31  37  41  43
l 47  53  59  61  67  71  73
l 79  83  89  97{END}

[spazio]Geomancy taps into the magick of the natural
environment for use in battle. Geomancy abilities depend
on the terrain of the tile on which the user is standing.
View the help message of the tile to see its geomancy
effect.{END}

[spazio]Some abilities may only be used when certain items are
in the party inventory. These are the the ninja's Throw
ability, the samurai's Iaido, and the chemist's Items.





[spazio]Simply knowing these abilities is not enough. The unit
must also have the requisite item. For example, the
Potion ability may only be executed when there is at least
one potion in the party inventory. Each time the Item or
Throw ability is used, one item in the party's possession
will be consumed, and using Iaido will sometimes cause
the katana to shatter.{END}

[spazio]If another unit or obstacle is in the line of fire when
attacking with a bow, crossbow, or gun, the attack will
not reach its intended target. This also applies to the
chemist's Throw Items ability. When the probability of
success for these actions is displayed as 0, it most
likely means something is in the way of the target.{END}

[spazio]The Jump attribute indicates how far a unit may jump.
A unit may jump vertically a difference in height equal to
its Jump attribute. However, a unit can jump only half
that distance across a horizontal gap. These rules are
automatically factored into your units' movement ranges.



[spazio]When jumping across a gap, the edge of the tile the
unit is standing on must be the same height or higher
than the edge on the other side. For example, a successful
jump can be made over a 1-tile gap from a height of 4.5h
to a height of 4h. However, a unit cannot jump a 1-tile
gap from a height of 4.5h to a height of 5h. The unit
must go to the bottom of the gap and find a way to climb
up.{END}

[spazio]Bodies of water on the battlefield, such as rivers and
canals, may partially submerge units. Water tiles have the
following effects:
- Walking is impeded, reducing movement range
- Units cannot perform actions in water of depth 2
- Some monsters cannot enter water{END}

[spazio]Weather in Ivalice can be divided into two alternating
periods of the Dry and the Rains.

[spazio]Dry months: Pisces, Aries, Taurus
[spazio]Wet months: Gemini, Cancer
[spazio]Dry months: Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio
[spazio]Wet months: Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius

[spazio]Weather patterns have the following effects during
battle:
1. Elemental magicks are affected by strong rain. Fire
Bmagicks are weakened, while ice and lightning magicks
Bare strengthened.
2. Strong rain makes it more difficult to walk in swamps.{END}

[spazio]The Reflect status effect causes magicks to bounce off
the affected unit and strike a different tile. The tile hit
is symmetric to the position of the caster and the
original target. For example, if the caster was two tiles
down and one tile left from the original target, the
reflected magick will strike the tile two tiles up and one
tile right from the original target.

[spazio]Here is an example:
 -  -  -  - [Portrait]gXo -  -  -  -  [Dialog]A magick with a radius of 2 is
 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  [Dialog]cast by the unit at C with [Quadrato] as
 -  -  -  - [Dialog] -  - [Portrait]!X: -  -  [Dialog]the target tile. The two units
 -  -  - W[Dialog]Re[Quadrato] -  -  -  -  [Dialog]marked R are within the magick's
 -  -  -  - [Dialog]gRo -  -  -  -  [Dialog]radius and affected by Reflect.
 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  [Dialog]The tiles to which the magick is
 -  - M[Dialog]CU -  -  -  -  -  -  [Dialog]reflected are each marked X.{END}

[spazio]Tiles on the battlefield are sometimes armed with
traps. Moving to such a tile will trigger the trap, causing
one of the following effects:

[spazio]Sten Needle Trap: HP loss
[spazio]Hypnogas Trap: Sleep
[spazio]Death Trap: Doom
[spazio]Degenerator: Level loss (-1){END}

[spazio]When a tile on the battlefield is armed with a trap, it
is often for the purpose of protecting an item hidden on
that tile. If a unit has the chemist's Treasure Hunter
ability, it can evade the trap and claim the hidden item.
However, the trap will remain on the tile until sprung,
even after the item has been found.{END}

[spazio]Once a unit has been KO'd, a countdown begins. If the
unit is not revived before the count reaches zero, the
unit will transform into a treasure chest or crystal and
be lost forever. If the unit becomes a crystal, its
equipment will be returned to the party inventory. If it
becomes a treasure chest, the unit's items are not all
automatically returned. Instead, one of the items will be
placed within the chest on the battlefield.{END}

[spazio]A unit's Faith indicates the level of his or her belief
in the divine. The higher this value, the more profound
the unit's belief and understanding of phenomena beyond
the mundane.




Faith affects the following:
1. The potency of offensive magicks
2. The potency of recovery magicks
3. The success rate of magicks that cause or remove
Bstatus effects



[spazio]If a unit's Faith becomes too high, the unit will lose
the will to fight and leave the party.{END}

[spazio]Bravery represents a unit's valor in combat situations.
It affects the following:
1. The chance of reaction abilities being triggered
2. Attack power for unarmed attacks and certain weapons
