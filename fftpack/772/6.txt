[spazio]Duke Goltanna stood in frustration as the war was
brought to an unexpected halt, and commanded Delita to
recommence a full-scale attack. It was then that Delita
abandoned his feigned loyalty to the duke and killed him.
Delita then prepared a body double of Count Orlandeau to
make it appear as though the duke had been assassinated
by the Thunder God. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]Ser Loffrey of the Knights Templar paid a visit to the
Beoulve manse in hopes of arbitrating a peace to the
conflict. But acceptance of such aid would mean kneeling
before the Church, and Lord Dycedarg promptly rejected
it. His veiled threats against the Church prompted Ser
Loffrey to express suspicions regarding the death of our
father, Lord Barbaneth. Before leaving, the knight gifted
the Capricorn Stone to Dycedarg. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]Lord Folmarv was in audience with Marquis Elmdore at
Limberry Castle. They spoke of their ultimate goal of
resurrecting the "Angel of Blood." Alma's flesh would be
required as a vessel. At word of my arrival, the marquis
made his way down to confront me. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]Marquis Elmdore had been possessed by a Lucavi, but
we managed to slay him in battle. It was then that Lady
Meliadoul learned the truth about the death of Ser Isilud,
her young brother, and at last we made our peace. She
entrusted the Sagittarius Stone to me, and informed me
of the Capricorn Stone being in my lord brother Dycedarg's
possession. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Wrongly imprisoned as a conspirator in the assassination
of Duke Goltanna, Orran escaped his cell and went to see
Ovelia in hopes of clearing Count Orlandeau's name. There
he found Delita, and harshly condemned him for betraying
the duke. Delita attempted to justify his actions, saying
that deception and betrayal were essential to his goal of
ruling the people as the hero they desired. Ovelia was
shocked by his words. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]Zalbaag, having overheard the conversation between
Dycedarg and Ser Loffrey, was prompted to investigate
our lord father's grave. Mossfungus caps had grown at the
gravesite, just as Ser Loffrey had said-proof that
Barbaneth Beoulve, our beloved lord father, had been
poisoned. Zalbaag stood in disbelief before Father's place
of rest. Our lord father had died at the hands of his own
son. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]Having lost numerous comrades and most of the Stones,
Lord Folmarv and his knights attacked High Confessor
Marcel. Lord Folmarv learned the location of the entrance
to the necrohol of Mullonde after threatening the High
Confessor with death. The gate was said to lie within the
vaults of Orbonne Monastery. The High Confessor pleaded
for his life, but was brutally slain by the knights, who then
headed for the monastery. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]I rushed to Mullonde Cathedral in hopes of finally being
reunited with Alma, only to find High Confessor Marcel
on the verge of death. The High Confessor was beyond help
at this point, but before his demise, he was able to tell
me where the Knights Templar had gone. I knew then that
Orbonne Monastery was my only hope of finding Lord
Folmarv, and ultimately my beloved sister Alma. (Press

[spazio]Besrudio Bunansa, machinist and father to young
Mustadio, uncovered a peculiar metal sphere from within
Tunnel 57, far beneath the city of Goug. None of us had
even a slight familiarity with its structure or use, but
for some reason it reacted to the Stone in my possession.
The symbol of Aquarius was engraved upon its surface.
(Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]We placed the Aquarius Stone into that peculiar metal
sphere uncovered from beneath Goug. At this, the sphere
reacted violently and began to change form. Standing
before us was a marvel of ancient technology-an iron
automaton in the form of a man. It seemed to recognize
me as a master of sorts, so I gave it an order. (Press [Triangolo]
to view.) {END}

[spazio]Besrudio recovered another marvel of the ancients
beneath Goug, this time from Tunnel 83. It looked to be
an orrery, and reacted to the Stone in my possession. The
symbol of Cancer was inscribed at its base, just as the
symbol of Aquarius had been inscribed upon that metallic
sphere. Like as not, a new Stone is needed to activate this
machine. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]The Cancer Stone triggered Besrudio's machine into
full activation. It seemed to be some type of teleportation
device-a gate leading to worlds of an outer dimension. As
we looked upon the globe in awe, a thunderous noise rang
out, and a young man was summoned before us. This being
from another world identified himself as "Cloud," and then
departed with these mysterious words: "I have to get
there..." (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]Reis was loved dearly by Beowulf, but due to the
jealously of a certain celebrant who pined for her love,
their relationship was brought to ruin. Realizing that Reis
felt no love for him, the celebrant flew into a fit of rage
and cast a curse upon Beowulf. But in a selfless act of
love, Reis took the curse in his stead. This curse had
doomed Reis to life as a dragon, but was lifted by power
of the Cancer Stone. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]On the verge of death, Ser Loffrey cast an ancient
spell found within the Scriptures of Germonique, calling
upon Zomal, the Reeve of Time. With it, we were all
transported through a fold in time and space, from the
vaults of Orbonne Monastery to the Necrohol of Mullonde.
Ser Loffrey conjured his last bit of strength to destroy
our only route of escape, then breathed his last. (Press

[spazio]Many had fallen, but at last the war was over. A funeral
service was held for Alma Beoulve at Eagrose Cemetery.
Alma and her brother AAAAAAAAAAAAAA were said to
have disappeared in the library vaults beneath Orbonne
Monastery near the end of the war. Their bodies, however,
were never recovered. After the mourners had paid their
respects and left, the young mage Valmafra stood over
Alma's gravestone with Orran. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}

[spazio]Several months had passed since the War of the Lions
had ended. Delita had taken Queen Ovelia as his bride, and
at last presided over all of Ivalice as king. A long-awaited
peace had finally returned to the war-torn land. On
Ovelia's birthday, Delita arrived at her side with a
bouquet of flowers. But he would give her something else
as well. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]With the aid of Gaffgarion and the others, we were able
to hold off Goltanna's troops. But to our dismay, Princess
Ovelia was abducted while we were engaged in battle. I
caught sight of one of Duke Goltanna's knights as he made
off with the princess, and strained to maintain my
composure as I laid eyes on his familiar face. Why would
Delita be serving Goltanna? (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]Wiegraf stood at the grave of his beloved sister

[spazio]I was reunited with my sister Alma at the postern of
Lesalia Castle, and revealed to her that the abduction of
the princess was part of a plot by our lord brother
Dycedarg. I further informed her that someone was
attempting to use the incident for their own ends, and
that Delita, too, was involved. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

[spazio]As Delita mourned the loss of his sister Tietra, he
heard Ovelia whistling with a blade of grass. They smiled

Zodiac Stones and the recent rash of robberies targeting

the sky pirate named Balthier. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

sought was in fact the auracite, I informed him of the

decided to join us on our journey. (Press [Triangolo] to view.){END}

as well. (Press [Triangolo] to view.) {END}
