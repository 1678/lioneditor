 
[spazio]The merchant ship Highwind had sunk some 20 sectas
out into Warjilis Harbor. As it was carrying the molds
needed to create chocobons, Psalmba Exports' newest
product, some have speculated that the ship may have been
sunk by a rival firm. However, it was determined to be an
accident when we successfully recovered both the ship and
its cargo.{END}

 
[spazio]The salvage expedition was sponsored by the Lesalia
Adventurers' Guild. Most attendees were young men and
women from landlocked regions who would otherwise never
get the chance to scour the depths for sunken treasure.
Happily, we found a sunken hull (like as not placed there by
our hosts) and succeeded in rescuing it from its watery
grave.{END}

 
[spazio]We took part in a diving expedition sponsored by
Thompson Traders, an outfitter located in Yardrow. There
was a wide variety of participants, from children to the
elderly, including many who might otherwise never have the
opportunity to go diving for treasure. Diving is not easy
work, but the participants accepted this and had a
fulfilling, if exhausting, time.{END}

 
[spazio]The Rhana Strait, located between Ivalice and the
Romandan peninsula, is infamous for its treacherous
waters. The Enterprise is only one of the many ships the
strait has claimed. Judging from the vessel's extravagant
design, it like as not belonged to a noble, but there are no
records of its ownership, and no hint as to why the
information was covered up.{END}

 
[spazio]We responded to the Zeltennia Salvagers' Guild call for
divers. The guild's operations had been on hiatus since a
scandal several years ago, and only resumed as of late.
Still, one would never know it from the contract that we
were made to sign, even for our short employment. As we
worked, we couldn't help but wonder what would become of
this guild, surrounded as it was by dark rumors.{END}

 
[spazio]We were informed that a trade ship called the
Hindenburg, registered to a Zaland trade company, went
down 16 sectas into the Bay of Obell. Prohibitive costs
kept the company from turning to a licensed salvage guild.
The waters in the area make it difficult to avoid the
occasional shipwreck, and the local guilds take advantage
of the lack of competition to charge steep rates.{END}

 
[spazio]We were told of a sunken vessel known as the Falcon at
the bottom of the West Bugross Sea. The Falcon was
thought to have encountered a typhoon as it carried
tributes from the continent, sinking the ship and drowning
her crew. Among those lost was a Lord Hamilton, emissary
to the Walled City of Yardrow. The job served to remind
us all how dangerous sea travel can be.{END}

 
[spazio]We learned that a ship said to belong to Mesa, the hero-
king who saved humanity in the Cataclysm, had foundered
not far off the shores of Goug. We immediately set to
work and succeeded in raising the great vessel. However,
a cursory examination of the ship revealed modern
construction. We later learned that the vessel belonged to
the Estoire Trading Company in Goug. We had been fooled.{END}

 
[spazio]We learned that the Durga, a merchant ship owned by
Barnvell Imports, had sunk 40 sectas into the Gulf of
Carnen. As the Durga carried a number of valuable goods
from the farthest corners of the continent, company
representatives were understandably nervous. We raised
the vessel, but her cargo had largely dissolved in the brine,
resulting in a substantial loss for the company.{END}

 
[spazio]A ship carrying a Lionel emissary was attacked by
pirates and sunk in waters not far off the coast. Her
cargo was clearly of extraordinary importance, as
countless others were working to raise the ship when we
arrived. Luckily, we were able to raise her and quickly
performed a search. In one of the passenger cabins, we
found a treasure that we claimed for ourselves.{END}

 
[spazio]We caught word that a vessel bearing gifts to the
Zaland Embassy had sunk. It apparently had been ravaged
by strong winds, as it was almost unrecognizable when we
raised it from the deep. The gifts it had carried were of
great value, and were to serve as a symbol of strong ties
between Zaland and the main continent. This loss is bound
to cause a bit of a rift between the two.{END}

 
[spazio]Several valuable tomes were stolen from the Gariland
Akademy for the Magickal Arts. According to witnesses,
the thief was a man of some thirty years. He was seen
escaping from a second-floor window and boarding a nearby
ferry. Unfortunately for him, the ferry sank. We raised
the vessel, but were unable to locate the books. Mayhap
they were washed away by the current.{END}

 
[spazio]We answered the Yardrow Salvage Guild's call for
divers. Attracted by the guild's claims of high income for
little effort, we quickly found it to be just the opposite.
We were worked from early morning until late at night for
a pittance. But at the very least we have learned that
when something sounds too good to be true, it oft is.{END}

 
[spazio]Gleddia Isle lies 15 sectas into the Inlet of Riovanes.
Waters in the area are swift and shallow, making
shipwrecks a common occurrence. However, as it is the
closest route to the inlet, many merchants who know not
of its treachery still venture near and are sunk. This was
no doubt the case with the ship we raised as well.{END}

 
[spazio]Another ship ran aground just off the coast of Gleddia
Isle, some 15 sectas out into the Inlet of Riovanes. The
ship was the Delphi, a large merchant vessel owned by
Eastgable Merchantry. As the ship was unregistered, we
conducted a routine search and discovered a large quantity
of illegal drugs being smuggled from the mainland. The
cargo was worth some 70 million gil on the open market.{END}

 
[spazio]The Dawn Queen, a merchant vessel owned by Galesta
Trading, capsized 35 sectas into the Bay of Seijista. It
seems that a birthday present for the company's owner
was on board. Moved by his assistant Holsecca's concern
for the man, we raised the vessel. Upon recovery of the
cargo, we were surprised to hear that Holsecca had in
truth been worried only for his job.{END}

 
[spazio]The abandoned mine expedition was sponsored by the
Lesalia Adventurers' Guild. Most attendees were young
men and women from coastal regions who might otherwise
never explore places such as this. Luckily, we struck a
vein of ore and even uncovered some lost treasure, making
this task a profitable one.{END}

 
[spazio]We took part in a mining expedition sponsored by
Thompson Traders, a Yardrow outfitter. There was a
wide variety of participants, both men and women, including
many who might otherwise never have the opportunity to
try their hand at mining. Mining is no easy task, but the
participants seemed to accept this and had a fulfilling, if
exhausting, time.{END}

 
[spazio]An information broker told us of a hidden vein of ore
in the long-abandoned Coldmann Mine. Apparently, it was
mentioned in the will of Old Toppa, the mine's former
manager. However, when we contacted Old Toppa's family,
we learned that his will had been stolen. Working with the
city guard, we apprehended the informant, a man named
Gordon, and restored the mining rights to the family.{END}

 
[spazio]We took part in a mining expedition sponsored by
Thompson Traders, a Yardrow outfitter. These trips seem
to be quite popular, as this is the second one that the
company has held in only a short period of time. The
location was moved to a more challenging mine this time,
but luckily one of the younger participants (Gotti, a boy
of nine) was able to find a vein of ore for us to mine.{END}

 
[spazio]We responded to a call for miners from the Ural Mine.
Only a short amount of time had passed since the incident
that had suspended operations but the mining company was
eager to make up for lost time. While we were digging, we
encountered a gigantic boulder, but with the help of all the
miners we were able to move it. This task reminded us
that any obstacle can be overcome with enough hard work.{END}

 
[spazio]The Orra Mine, famous for a spectacular vein of gold,
suffered a cave-in not long ago. It seems that in their
rush to mine the gold, the miners were too greedy and dug
too deep. Ten miners lost their lives in the cave-in, but
the company still continues to mine and has yet to admit
any wrongdoing.{END}

 
[spazio]The Ducatia Mine has put out a request for miners.
This generally occurs only when new veins of ore are
discovered, and since no new ore has been found in this
mine since the discovery of a copper vein several years
ago, this would indeed be good news. But since the copper
miners are still employed, some suspect this urgent need
for extra miners can only mean gold has been discovered.{END}

 
[spazio]Mount Gulg has not erupted for nigh on 5000 years,
yet dangers enough remain that few dare venture near.
But we did, and it was at the bottom of that deep, dark
shaft we saw her: a lady of flame! Locals tell of a young
girl who stumbled over the volcano's rim, though the truth
of it we could not say. Nonetheless, we erected a small
shrine and offered prayers for the Mount Gulg Maiden.{END}

 
[spazio]At last we returned from the Endless Caverns. It
seems the unique nature of the caverns was the reason
why none had ever before returned. The caves' strong
magnetic field and monotonous, grid-like layout have a
paralyzing effect on one's sense of direction. However,
marking our path allowed us to escape and at last dispel
the mystery surrounding the caverns.{END}

 
[spazio]We have conquered the Himca Cliffs! Searching for a
hidden vein of gold, we reached the top of the misty
peaks, and fields of grass seemed to extend endlessly
before us. In the distance stood an enormous tree, the
likes of which we had never seen. Mayhap it was the World
Tree itself. As we left, we felt as if we had witnessed
one of the wonders of the world.{END}

 
[spazio]We found a god in the Godsvale! We dug down some 30
sectas in search of ore deposits when our trench opened
up into some ancient catacombs. We had just constructed a
small shrine, and were praying for the souls interred in
the tombs around us, when suddenly the figure of a man
garbed in shimmering robes appeared before us. Then he
disappeared as quickly as he came.{END}

 
[spazio]We discovered that mining had resumed in Balvack
Mine, albeit on a temporary basis. The miners sought to
put any rumors of hidden gold to rest once and for all, and
of course we joined them. As we were digging, an old
miner remarked, "It feels like we're back in the gold rush
again." What could that old man have seen in that empty
shell of a mine?{END}

 
[spazio]Ducatia Mine was again recruiting miners. As only days
had passed since the first recruitment drive, we decided
to look into the situation. Upon being hired, we were
subjected to an even stricter examination before finally
being allowed into the mine itself. Once inside, we
confirmed that a gold vein had indeed been discovered and
was being mined in secret.{END}

 
[spazio]The Lorraide Mine went bankrupt several years ago,
just after striking mythril. According to former miners,
a secret vein of ore was locked behind a door at the very
bottom of the mine. We immediately investigated. The
mine had transformed into a veritable dungeon, and when
we finally opened the door at its bottom, we found the
ghost of a miner, still digging from the rich vein.{END}

 
[spazio]A gold rush some years ago caused numerous towns to
crop up at the foot of Mount Ourobos, and for a time the
mountain crawled with prospectors. However, the meager
amount of gold found could not support the towns. The
miners soon left, turning the villages into little more than
ghost towns. All that remained of the miners' dreams were
the tears of the old man who told us his tale.{END}

 
[spazio]To combat the theft and violence prevalent during the
Fifty Years' War, the Sal Ghidos Council created an elite
guard made of fifteen knights who had proven their worth
on the battlefield. This group of black-clad warriors was
known as the Sable Swords. It is said they perished after
falling prey to a bandit's trap in Death's Gorge, but even
today people report sightings of ghostly figures in black.{END}

 
[spazio]The Merchant Council of Dorter sponsored a frontier
marathon. Participants competed with one another to find
lost remnants of ancient civilization. All we had to go on
was information gleaned from ancient texts, legends, and
stories as we raced to be the first to find undiscovered
ruins.{END}

 
[spazio]Combing Lake Poescas for lost ruins, we were startled
to see a dark shadow move by in the distance. Consulting
with a scholar learned in such matters, we learned that
the lake had been part of the sea in ancient times. He
believed we had witnessed a rare appearance of Poessie,
an ancient sea dragon trapped there when Lake Poescas
was cut off from the sea by geological shifts.{END}

 
[spazio]The Merchant Council of Dorter sponsored a second
frontier marathon. There were even more participants
this time, and a change to the rules allowed us to use
vehicles, which greatly increased the potential search
area. We rented a chocobo carriage not far from the
starting area, and succeeded yet again in finding a lost
ancient wonder.{END}

 
[spazio]The Lenalian Plateau is thought to be home to demons
and all manner of evil spirit. A line from local legend
reads, "And a demon descended upon the high plateau of
Lenalia, and the world was plunged into darkness."
However, we witnessed only a series of quiet, rolling hills
with no apparent relation to the cursed land of legend. And
yet as we left, we did feel a strange chill.{END}

 
[spazio]The Merchant Council of Dorter sponsored a third
frontier marathon. The success of the first two races
meant that there were even more participants this time.
Some complained of the expanded search area, but after
the race began, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. It is
said that the next race will not be held for some time,
until more reports of lost ruins have surfaced.{END}

 
[spazio]One of the main trade routes between Gariland and
Dorter passes through the Siedge Weald. Said route was
only opened of late, mayhap to avoid the bandits on the
Lenalian Plateau. It therefore abounds with areas yet to
be explored, and we used the knowledge given us to
discover the ancient wonder deep within the weald.{END}

 
[spazio]The Beddha Sandwaste crawls with monsters. We were
warned of this on the very day we set off in search of the
lost ruins. A monster known as a sandworm is said to
appear at the end of each month, bringing blackened skies
and sandstorms that shut the desert off from the outside
world. Is this an attempt to protect the ruins' legacy, or a
message to humans who dare defile remnants of the past?{END}

 
[spazio]Lamzen the Adventurer hailed from the main continent,
coming to Ivalice by way of Romanda. He was an explorer
of some renown on the mainland, and made a number of
important discoveries there. We joined his party and set
off, exploring the unfamiliar Zeklaus Desert. Thanks in
part to his experience, we located the ruins.{END}

 
[spazio]After hearing the old farmer's account, we made our
way to Dugeura Pass. There we witnessed an unusual local
ceremony, in which they danced around an elemental. We
later learned that it was a sacrificial ceremony in ancient
times, performed today as part of a festival. Although
unrelated to the ruins we found beyond the pass, it was
an interesting sight nevertheless.{END}

 
[spazio]We took part in a frontier expedition. Such expeditions
are popular, for the prospect of discovering lost wonders
gives hope to those exhausted by the mundanity of
everyday life. As a surprising number of people attended,
we divided ourselves into groups of 10 and set off
exploring at dawn. We forged deep into the jungle, where
we found remnants of an ancient, advanced civilization.{END}

 
[spazio]The poisonous fens of the Tchigolith Fenlands are a
remnant of the Fifty Years' War, and even today their
desolation bears silent witness to the brutality of that
conflict. But as we were departing for home, we saw
something extraordinary: a celsettia flower blooming amid
the deadly mists. By the time our children are grown,
might these fens again be covered in celsettia blossoms?{END}

 
[spazio]Judging by its design and style, Master Joshul, who has
studied ancient architecture for a half century, was of
the opinion that the dungeon found beneath the marquis's
estate was a relic of ancient civilization. Such labyrinths
were used to protect valuable artefacts, and with the help
of Master Joshul, we were able to reach its center and
discover the ancient wonder that lay within.{END}

 
[spazio]The Vaschons are an unusual group of adventurers,
exploring regions previously untouched by man and then
teaching others about them. As their notoriety has grown,
so have their numbers, but the captain's natural leadership
ability allows her to easily coordinate their efforts. She
recorded every step of our journey, from beginning to
successful discovery. We look forward to reading it later.{END}

 
[spazio]We headed off to investigate the farmer's tale. The
mountain was beautiful, bathed in mist like something out
of a fairy tale. Yet even in that seemingly untouched
wilderness, the effects of the war were evident. We will
not tell you what we saw there; it is best seen for
oneself. We left with mixed emotions, knowing that even
this hidden bit of paradise would eventually disappear.{END}

 
[spazio]They say that faith reveals all things, but it seems
this does not apply to lost ruins. The man who told us of
these ruins, a merchant by the name of Bibbitt, has faith
only in gold. When we told him of the ruins we had
discovered, he ran from the tavern to see for himself. We
can only hope this whole experience taught him that there
is more to life than gold.{END}

 
[spazio]Mount Vector is a mysterious place where rain falls
continuously. This soft rain was quite relaxing and served
to soothe our battle-weary bones. The high temperatures
in the region mean that the mountain is always swathed
in mist, leading to stories of white demons that prey on
travelers. We located the ruins, and bid this oasis for the
