[spazio]If you wish to challenge another player to battle via Ad
Hoc Mode, select "Melee" at a tavern. One player should
select "Host Melee Battle," while the other player selects
"Join Melee Battle." Once a connection is made, the
hosting player will then be prompted to set the rules of
engagement and start the battle.


[spazio]A melee battle ends once all of one player's units have
been KO'd, or the maximum number of actions has been
performed. If the battle ends due to the action limit
being reached, then the player with the most units
remaining is the winner. Items are then awarded based on
the battle results, concluding the melee battle session.{END}

[spazio]Melee rules must be set before the battle begins.

1. [Portrait]Map Selection:[Dialog] Determines whether the map is selected
Bby the hosting player or at random.
2. [Portrait]Time Limit:[Dialog] Determines how much total time is allotted
Bto each player to spend deciding units' actions.
3. [Portrait]Action Limit:[Dialog] Determines the total number of actions
Bthat each side may perform in battle.
4. [Portrait]Special Controls:[Dialog] Determines whether special time-
Bsensitive controls will be used in the battle.
5. [Portrait]Trap Placement:[Dialog] Determines whether traps are set
Bmanually or at random.
6. [Portrait]Number of Traps:[Dialog] Determines the number of traps
Bthat may be set in a single battle.
7. [Portrait]Arithmeticks:[Dialog] Determines whether the Arithmeticks
Bability may be used during battle.{END}

[spazio]The battle ends once all units belonging to either player
are KO'd. If the action limit is reached before this
occurs, the player with the most remaining units at the
end of the battle is the winner. If both players have the
same number of units left, the battle ends in a draw.
[spazio]After the battle, three items are awarded to the
winner, and one is awarded to the loser. In the case of a
draw, two items are awarded to each player.{END}

[spazio]Units KO'd in melee are not permanently lost. They will
disappear from the battlefield when their KO countdowns
expire, but rejoin the party after battle. All equipment
and items which are consumed or destroyed during battle
will likewise be restored to their previous states once
the battle has ended.


[spazio]The only unit attribute that changes permanently as a
result of multiplayer battles is JP. Aside from JP and
subsequent job level increases, all attributes return to
their original values at the end of the battle.{END}

[spazio]The following controls will be used in melee battles if
the Special Controls option is turned on.

- After selecting "Attack," pressing [Croce] just before the
7unit's weapon strikes will knock the enemy back one tile.



- If the hit probability for an attack is near 50, both
7players will be prompted to press [Croce] repeatedly once the
7attack is confirmed. The outcome will depend on which
7player presses the button the greater number of times.
- If a unit enters a tile containing a trap, a sequence of
7buttons will be displayed. Pressing the correct buttons in
7the correct order within the time limit will disarm the
7trap.{END}

[spazio]Setting the trap placement method to either "Random"
or "Manual" enables the placement of traps on the melee
map. If a unit moves into a tile trapped by the opposing
player, the unit will be affected in one of several ways,
depending on the type of trap. Traps you placed cannot be
triggered by your own units. However, your units will be
affected if they are within the area of effect of a trap
sprung by one of your opponent's units.
Triggering a trap results in the following effects:
7[Portrait]Sten Needle Trap:[Dialog] HP loss
7[Portrait]Hypnogas Trap:[Dialog] Sleep
7[Portrait]Death Trap:[Dialog] Doom
7[Portrait]Mine:[Dialog] HP loss, Oil
7[Portrait]Mossfungus Trap:[Dialog] Poison
7[Portrait]Cursed Stone:[Dialog] Undead

Traps cannot be set on the following types of tiles:
- Tiles to which no unit may move
- Tiles that units can occupy at the start of battle
- Water tiles with a depth greater than 1{END}

[spazio]Rendezvousing with another player allows you to team
up in order to complete cooperative missions via Ad Hoc
Mode. Select "Rendezvous" from the menu in any tavern to
access them. After selecting "Start a Mission" from the
Rendezvous submenu, you will be given the option of
hosting a mission or joining one hosted by another player.
One player should select "Host Mission," while the other
selects "Join Mission."
[spazio]Once a connection is made, the hosting player will be
prompted to select a mission. All missions for which
either player has fulfilled the necessary requirements will
be available to choose from. Once a decision has been made
by the host and confirmed by the other player, both will
then proceed to the squad formation screen.


[spazio]Cooperative battles are much the same as single-player
battles, but the number of units allowed in battle will
differ according to the mission. There are also several
special rules that apply to cooperative battles. As in
melee, KO'd units are not permanently removed from your
party, and units gain no EXP in battle. Additionally, the
use of Arithmeticks is prohibited.

[spazio]Fulfilling the objectives displayed at the start of battle
completes the mission. The participants will then be
evaluated on a scale of one to five stars, and awarded
items according to the results. You can repeat a
particular mission any number of times, allowing you to
keep trying until you earn the best evaluation.{END}

[spazio]Only one mission will be available at first, but new
ones will be unlocked as you advance through the game and
fulfill certain requirements. The currently available
missions and their descriptions may be viewed at any
tavern by selecting "Rendezvous," then "View Available
Missions."


[spazio]The hosting player is always responsible for selecting
the mission. However, all missions unlocked by either
player will appear in the list for the hosting player to
choose from.{END}

[spazio]Only a small number of units are permitted in your
squad for cooperative mission battles. Most missions
allow a maximum of three units per player, and some only
allow two units each. Some missions require that multiple
battles be fought in succession.



Abilities are restricted in the following ways:
[spazio]1. Arithmeticks cannot be used.
[spazio]2. No gil can be acquired.
[spazio]3. Poaching is not possible.




[spazio]The Arithmeticks ability cannot be used at all, and
abilities that allow a unit to acquire gil have no effect.
When the Poach ability is assigned to a unit, it may
result in monsters being successfully poached during
battle, but nothing will become available at poachers' dens
as a result. Keep these rules in mind when assigning
abilities to your units.{END}

[spazio]Only two unit attributes will change permanently as a
result of mission battles: JP, and abilities learned from
crystals on the battlefield. All other attributes will be
reset to their original values at the battle's end. Poached
monsters and units transformed by malboro spores will
also be restored to their former states.{END}

[spazio]Units KO'd in cooperative battles are not permanently
lost. They will disappear from the battlefield when their
KO countdowns expire, but rejoin the party after the
mission has been completed. When completing missions
that consist of multiple battles in a row, units defeated
in one battle will not be able to participate in any
subsequent battles, greatly hindering your ability to
fight.{END}

[spazio]Once a mission is completed, all lost items will be
restored and any items obtained during battle will be
added to the party inventory. Restored items include
consumables that were used with the Items or Auto-
Potion abilities, stolen equipment, equipment destroyed
by enemy attacks, swords shattered when using Iaido, and
weapons thrown with the Throw ability.

[spazio]Although items are restored after completing a
mission, keep in mind that losing them will make it more
difficult to complete the mission in the first place. It
would still be wise to assign the Safeguard or Reequip
abilities to units to ensure they are not deprived of
equipment.


[spazio]Items which may be acquired in battle include those
taken from chests, weapons caught with the Sticky
Fingers ability, and equipment stolen from enemies. You
cannot take items from the other player's units. After
successfully completing the mission, a number of rewards
will be awarded to each player as well.{END}

[spazio]Although you are unable to acquire gil during mission
battles, a gil bonus is awarded for completing the battle,
just as it is for completing a normal battle.{END}

[spazio]Items are awarded to each player upon completion of a
mission. The value of these rewards depends on luck. The
items are kept hidden in chests, making it impossible to
know what item will be obtained until a chest is chosen.
The number of chests each player may open depends on the
evaluations they receive.


[spazio]Mission results are evaluated on a scale of one to five,
and a better evaluation results in more items being
awarded. The maximum number of items awarded is five.
To receive a higher evaluation, you must defeat more
enemies or complete the mission with a smaller number of
units. If your units are KO'd, your evaluation will go down.


[spazio]The tavernmaster will inform you of your evaluation
once the mission is over. After you have cleared a
particular task at least once, you may check your
evaluation at any time by selecting "Rendezvous" and then
"View Available Missions." The number of stars displayed
to the right of the title indicates your best evaluation
for that particular mission.{END}
