[spazio]Brigandry is on the rise across the land, and Gallionne
has by no means been spared. Wains are struck and pillaged,
high-ranking officials taken at swordpoint. Most of the
incidents of this past six-month are believed to be the
work of a company of felons and former sellswords known
as the Corpse Brigade.


[spazio]It is oft said the only good brigand is a dead brigand,
and the Order of the Northern Sky would like naught more
than to see the Brigade made corpses for true. But as
yet, it is all the knighthood can do to keep the outlaws in
check.{END}

8191[spazio]The health of King Ondoria III has been a subject of
concern since his collapse at the birthday celebration of
Prince Orinus. The Board of Chamberlains has since
announced that the king has regained consciousness and
his fever has broken, but will yet require several weeks
of quietude and bed rest in order to recover.


[spazio]Many speculate that it may be some months before the
king resumes his official duties. However, Queen Louveria
and her retainers have long been in charge of most affairs
of state, and thus few problems are anticipated during the
king's absence.{END}

[spazio]The half-century of conflict between Ivalice and
Ordallia is today known as the Fifty Years' War.
[spazio]The beginning of the Fifty Years' War can be traced to
the death of Ordallia's King Devanne III, and his failure to
name a successor. His cousin, Varoi VI, was next in line
for the throne; however, King Denamda II of Ivalice (the
uncle of Devanne III) proclaimed himself the rightful heir
and declared war on Ordallia.
[spazio]However, this was merely a pretense to justify the
invasion of the neighboring Ordallian province of Zelmonia.
Once an independent state, it had been annexed by Ordallia
nearly a century prior. Ivalice had since been aiding the
province in an effort to weaken Ordallia-an effort that
ultimately failed. Tired of Ordallian rule, the Zelmonian
leadership and nobility secretly petitioned Ivalice to take
a more direct hand in their liberation.
[spazio]After a victory in Zelmonia, the Ivalician armies
marched on the Ordallian capital of Viura. As fate would
have it, Denamda II succumbed to fatal illness on the
road. The momentary confusion amongst Ivalice's troops
gave Ordallia the opportunity it needed to regroup, and
Varoi VI succeeded in pushing the Ivalicians back as far
as Zelmonia. The resulting impasse would not be broken
until the Romandan army's invasion two years hence.
[spazio]Romanda, a powerful military state lying across the
Rhana Strait, marched on Ivalice at the behest of Varoi
VI, a blood relation of the Romandan nobility. However,
Denamda II's successor Denamda IV was a fearless
warrior, personally leading his men into battle against
the combined might of Romanda and Ordallia. This, along
with an outbreak of the Black Death in Romanda, forced
the Romandan army to withdraw after only three years.
[spazio]Two military orders worthy of particular mention in
this conflict are the Order of the Northern Sky, led by
Knight Gallant Barbaneth Beoulve, and that of the
Southern Sky, led by Cidolfus Orlandeau, known also as
the Thunder God.



[spazio]After countless victories at home, these two orders
had been poised to advance into Ordallia. However, the
protracted conflict had begun to take its toll on domestic
morale. Peasant uprisings and revolts throughout Ivalice
and Ordallia forced both countries to send their troops
home to pacify their own citizens, resulting in another
stalemate.

[spazio]It was Denamda IV's sudden death by malady that broke
the stalemate, although some claim that he was murdered.
His successor, Ondoria III, was ill suited to the throne,
and left the governing of Ivalice to his queen and retainers.
Without Denamda IV's leadership, the armies of Ivalice had
little prayer of preventing Varoi VI's successor, Prince
Lennard, from defeating the troops stationed in Zelmonia
and advancing into Ivalice proper.
[spazio]Despite the valiant efforts of the Northern and
Southern Orders, Ivalice failed to repel Prince Lennard's
invasion of Zeltennia. Ivalice's leaders soon began looking
for a peaceful alternative. In the end, both states agreed
that prolonging the war would prove mutually detrimental,
and a pact was signed allowing each nation to return to
addressing domestic strife. An equal peace in name, it was
in reality a defeat for Ivalice.
[spazio]The economy of Ivalice was brought to the very brink
of ruin as it struggled to pay reparations to its former
enemies and to repay the loans taken from neighboring
states to fund its war effort. Soldiers returning from
the front found themselves without pay, and entire orders
of knights were summarily discharged from service. The
swelling ranks of the unemployed did little to relieve the
people's distrust of the Crown and the nobility.{END}

[spazio]The capital is rife with rumors that King Ondoria III's
condition has taken a sudden turn for the worse. Although
official word is that he has been steadily improving since
his collapse at Prince Orinus's birthday celebration, the
looks on the faces of his aides tell a different story. If
the king should pass without naming a regent for the
young prince, a battle over succession between the
Council and the Crown seems inevitable.{END}

[spazio]The Corpse Brigade, the worst band of outlaws to
terrorize Gallionne in recent memory, has been defeated
thanks to the combined efforts of the four great knightly
orders, led by the Order of the Northern Sky. It is said
that some seven hundred of the brigands have been
captured and more than three thousand killed in the
campaign to bring the Corpse Brigade to justice.

[spazio]The Brigade's leader, Wiegraf Folles, has yet to be
captured, but a representative of the Northern Order has
sworn that it is merely a matter of time before Folles is
brought to justice.{END}

[spazio]While the Corpse Brigade has been vanquished, their
leader Wiegraf Folles continues to evade justice. And even
as the Order of the Northern Sky worked to round up the
last of the Brigade, former Brigade members led an attack
on the manse of the esteemed House Beoulve at Eagrose.
Their target is said to have been none other than Duke
Larg's advisor, Lord Dycedarg Beoulve. Fortunately, the
attempt was thwarted.{END}

[spazio]Since the death of King Ondoria III, Queen Louveria's
campaign to seize total control of the government has
proceeded apace. All who oppose her-even members of the
Council-are mercilessly stripped of their rank. Even the
queen mother, who had openly criticized the actions of her
son's wife, was banished to Bunahan, never to return. Her
fate is unknown, although some say she was poisoned.{END}

[spazio]Duke Larg, trueborn brother of Queen Louveria, and
Duke Goltanna, cousin of the late king, are locked in a
fierce political struggle for control of Ivalice. Both men
hope to be appointed guardian of Prince Orinus and thus
gain the title and authority of regent. Although the queen
supports Duke Larg, a goodly number of nobles and Council
members appear to back Duke Goltanna, and there are
rumors he may be officially appointed regent ere long.{END}

[spazio]Peasants riot throughout Duke Goltanna's province of
Zeltennia. This sudden outbreak of civil unrest stems from
the unanticipated loss of crops due to last year's drought,
coupled with the burden of taxes that have been steadily
rising since the end of the Fifty Years' War. A group of
former knights calling itself the Order of the Ebon Eye
appears to be fomenting the violence, even as Baron
Grimms' Blackram Knights struggle to contain it.{END}

[spazio]Princess Ovelia has been kidnapped from Orbonne
Monastery. Witnesses claim the knights responsible bore
the crest of the Black Lion, leading many to conclude
that it was the work of Duke Goltanna's Order of the
Southern Sky. The duke, however, denies involvement and
is dispatching a search party in an effort to prove his
innocence. Given the unrest in Zeltennia, it seems doubtful
he will be able to spare many men for the effort.{END}

[spazio]Long ago, before Ivalice was united as it is today, the
land was divided into seven kingdoms: Zeltennia, Fovoham,
Lionel, Limberry, Lesalia, Gallionne, and Mullonde. Each
kingdom clashed with the others in an endless effort to
expand its own territory.



[spazio]The conflict continued for centuries, until a brave and
ambitious young king appeared in Mullonde. This king dreamt
of uniting all of Ivalice under his hand, but such feats are
not with ease achieved. Turning to ancient tomes and the
dark magicks found within, he summoned a demon from the
netherworld to do his bidding. But once unleashed, the
demon could not be controlled. It slew the king and set out
to destroy the world of men.
[spazio]Twelve brave warriors were gathered to slay the demon
and the foul horrors that it had summoned. They soon
defeated the horrors and banished the demon back to the
netherworld. These twelve warriors each carried with
them a crystal engraved with a sign of the zodiac, and so
became known as the Zodiac Braves.{END}

[spazio]These crystals are said to date from the age of myth.
Each bears the mark of a sign of the zodiac, leading them
to be called the Zodiac Stones. They are thought to harbor
divine power which allowed the Zodiac Braves to perform
astonishing miracles. Their last appearance in historical
records dates from the time of Saint Ajora. Since then,
the Zodiac Stones have remained hidden from mortal sight.{END}

[spazio]The Baert Trading Company, a successful trading
company based in the merchant city of Warjilis, has
garnered the favor of the populace by donating generously
to bridge- and road-building projects, as well as to local
orphanages. But not all of the talk surrounding this
company is favorable. Many say the true source of the
trading company's wealth is of a most unsavory nature-
opium smuggling, slave trading, and even murder most foul.{END}

[spazio]Three months have passed since the Battle of
Groffovia-the first full-scale battle between the forces
of Lesalia and Limberry on the plains that define the
border of their two lands. Formidable knights, once allies
in war, now meet each other as enemies on the battlefield
in skirmishes with no clear victor-bloody clashes that
have resulted in close to four hundred thousand casualties.

[spazio]Many say that the two sides have reached an impasse,
and the prospect of a protracted struggle does little to
bolster the already low spirits of the people.{END}

[spazio]Princess Ovelia, abducted from Orbonne Monastery, has
now been rescued. To the shock of many, the culprits were
Duke Goltanna's aide Chancellor Glevanne and, it seems,
Queen Louveria herself. Rumor holds that the queen
instructed the chancellor to dispose of the princess, thus
placing her own son next in line for the throne. Chancellor
Glevanne has been put to death for the plot, but the queen
denies all knowledge of it.
[spazio]The young warrior who saved the princess is said to be
a lieutenant in Baron Grimms' Blackram Knights by the
name of Delita Heiral. In honor of his achievement, he is
expected to be given leadership of the knights in place of
Baron Grimms, who was killed in battle against the Order
of the Ebon Eye.{END}

[spazio]It has been three months since the death of Cardinal
Delacroix, liege lord of Lionel. Although his death has
been attributed to malady, many speculate that he was
assassinated. Some even say that he was slain by an
otherworldly fiend. The violent assault on Lionel Castle
by a band of brigands on the eve of Delacroix's death
lends momentum to such outlandish rumors, for strangely
enough, the slain appeared to have been crushed to death.{END}

[spazio]Famine the likes of which have not been seen in decades
has descended upon Ivalice. The eastern lands of Zeltennia
and Limberry suffer from a drought which has reduced the
harvest to half that of a normal year. And to the west in
Gallionne and Fovoham, widespread flooding has also
destroyed close to half of all crops. The capital of Lesalia
is awash with refugees who have lost their homes in the
war, or who are simply in search of food.{END}

[spazio]The marquis Elmdore de Limberry, dubbed the "Silver
Prince" by his friends and "Silver Demon" by his foes,
was slain by a stray arrow in battle on the Fusse Plains.
Despite his noble title, he was a popular figure amongst
the common people and a devout member of the Church of
Glabados. A steady stream of mourners pay respects at
his grave. He was a steadfast general of Duke Goltanna's,
and it seems a certainty that his death will affect the war.{END}

[spazio]Having apparently lost patience with the long stalemate,
Duke Larg's troops have at last taken action. The Order
of the Northern Sky, along with most of the soldiers on
the front lines, have marched on Fort Besselat. Besselat
is an indispensable strongpoint in the battle against
Zeltennia, and capturing it would give Duke Larg's forces
access to Limberry's abundant food supply. This battle
could well be the key to victory.{END}

[spazio]Just as rumors of the otherworldly fiend that attacked
Lionel Castle begin to die down, another is now said to
have appeared at Riovanes-the residence of Grand Duke
Barrington. More than five hundred men lost their lives in
the ensuing battle. No witnesses survived and there are
no clues as to what occurred. Those who have seen the
aftermath say that they will never forget the scores of
corpses, some with their heads crushed like melons.{END}

G61[spazio]Monsters have taken up residence in one of the many
coal mines in Gollund. The local government sent out a call
for knights to slay the beasts, but the war has made
finding able-bodied men difficult. Anxious to be rid of the
monsters, the government is now offering a reward for
any commoner who can slay them. One can only hope that
such a hero will be found soon.{END}

H01[spazio]The isle of Nelveska lies some eighty thousand dohms
north of Zeltennia. The center of the island is home to the
ruins of many ancient temples which served as a crucial
base for the warriors fighting Ordallia's forces during the
Fifty Years' War. Although Nelveska may appear to be a
lush jungle paradise, the local fishermen avoid it, claiming
that it is cursed, and a "fearsome iron sentinel" will
slaughter any who dare approach.{END}

2141[spazio]Clergymen from all over Ivalice have been reporting
thefts as of late. All of the items stolen have been jewels
in the care of religious institutions, leading the Church of
Glabados to conclude that the crimes are the work of
heretics or other enemies of the Church. Anticipating
further incidents, it has warned its members to exercise
particular vigilance.{END}

31[spazio]The city of Bervenia has donated a treasure known as
the Wailing Orte to the city of Dorter, and a merchant has
been commissioned to make the delivery. However, recent
rumors of bandits on the trade routes have him too
frightened to make the journey. He seeks guards with
strong swordarms to protect him along his way.{END}

41[spazio]The Order of the Northern Sky lost their leader, Duke
Larg, at the battle of Fort Besselat. Their misfortune
was followed by further tragedies: the mysterious
disappearance of their commander Lord Zalbaag, and the
murder of Lord Dycedarg. These events exacerbated the
discontent already present in the Order, causing a group
of knights to defect, taking up residence in a former
brigands' den and terrorizing nearby towns.{END}

51[spazio]Several months had passed since the murder of Cardinal
Delacroix, and the question of who would succeed him as
liege lord of Lionel had been on everyone's minds. Although
a fierce struggle for power no doubt occurred behind the
scenes, Celebrant Bremondt was chosen in the end as
expected. He is known for his genial disposition and
uncompromising pursuit of heretics, and most have high
hopes for his future as Lionel's new ruler.{END}
