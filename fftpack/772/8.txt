[spazio]Status effects are divided into the following
categories:[Dialog]
[spazio]1. Action States (results of action)
[spazio]2. Beneficial Effects
[spazio]3. Status Ailments
[spazio]4. Physical States (due to HP loss)
[spazio]5. Other (can be beneficial or detrimental)
The following is a brief explanation of each category.[Dialog]

[spazio]To learn how the various status effects can be
removed, check the help messages for abilities, items,
and the status effects themselves.{END}

[spazio]When a unit is KO'd, a countdown begins. The speed of
the countdown depends upon the KO'd unit's Speed
attribute. When the count reaches zero, the unit dies and
a crystal or treasure chest appear in its place. It is
impossible to resurrect a unit once its body has
disappeared. If used before the unit's body disappears,
phoenix down or the white magick Raise will revive a
fallen unit.{END}

[spazio]The universe and all things within it are composed of
eight elements: earth, fire, wind, water, ice, lightning,
holy, and dark. These elements and the relationships
between them govern the fates of all beings. Although not
everything in the universe has an elemental alignment,
many units and items react to certain elements in special
ways. In these cases, the following terms will be used in
their help text descriptions.
[Portrait]Absorbs:[Dialog] Damage of the specified elements is absorbed as
HP. For example, when an ice-absorbing unit is attacked
with the black magick Blizzard, the unit will recover HP
instead of taking damage.
[Portrait]Negates:[Dialog] Damage of the specified elements is negated.
For example, when a lightning-negating unit is attacked
with a magick such as Thunder, the unit receives no
damage.
[Portrait]Halves:[Dialog] Damage of the specified elements is halved.
[Portrait]Weakness:[Dialog] Damage of the specified elements is increased.
For example, if a unit with a weakness to fire is
attacked with the Fire magick, the unit will take more
damage than another would.
[Portrait]Boosts:[Dialog] Damage of the specified elements dealt by the
unit is increased. For example, when a unit with a boost
to ice casts Blizzard, it will deal more damage than usual.{END}

[spazio]Various types of items can be equipped to different
locations on a unit. Their effects vary accordingly.

[Portrait]Right Hand, Left Hand[Dialog]
Weapons may be equipped in the hands. Equipping a weapon
will increase a unit's Attack attribute. If the support
ability Parry is assigned to a unit, the unit can also use
the weapon to block physical attacks.
[spazio]Normally, a unit can equip only a single weapon in
either its right or left hand. Units with the Equip
Shields ability can equip a shield in the other hand. If the
Dual Wield ability is assigned to a unit, it can equip a
weapon in each hand. The Doublehand ability allows certain
one-handed weapons to be wielded with both hands (two-
handed weapons are always wielded with both hands and do
not require the Doublehand ability to equip).
[Portrait]Head[Dialog]
Hats and helms may be equipped upon the head. Equipping
these items will increase a unit's HP or MP. The
headgear a unit may equip depends upon the unit's job and
assigned support ability. The Equip Heavy Armor ability
allows a unit to equip helms regardless of his or her job.


[Portrait]Body[Dialog]
Clothing, armor, and robes may be equipped upon the body.
Equipping these items will increase a unit's HP or MP.
The armor a unit may equip differs according to the
unit's job and assigned support ability. Equip Heavy
Armor allows a unit to equip armor regardless of his or
her job.

[Portrait]Accessories[Dialog]
Accessories include items such as shoes, rings, and
cloaks. These items often provide unique effects, such as
boosting attributes or granting immunity to status
effects. For example, Battle Boots provide a +1 bonus to
a unit's Move attribute.


[spazio]Pressing SELECT to view the help text for an item
allows you to check its bonuses and compatible jobs.{END}

[spazio]A unit's job levels depend on the amount of JP the unit
has earned towards each particular job. As a unit's job
levels increase, new jobs will become available to that
unit. For example, a unit must reach level 2 as a chemist
in order to become a white mage.



[spazio]There are no prerequisites for becoming a squire or
chemist. Once a unit has reached a squire job level of 2,
he or she may become a knight or archer. Likewise, once a
unit has reached a chemist job level of 2, he or she may
become a white mage or black mage. There are many other
jobs available to units as well, but you will have to
discover their requirements on your own.{END}

[spazio]The following jobs have inherent abilities, which are
effective even without being assigned to the unit:
[Portrait]Chemist:[Dialog] Throw Items (boosts range of item use)
[Portrait]Monk:[Dialog] Brawler (boosts unarmed attack strength)
[Portrait]Orator:[Dialog] Beast Tongue (allows Speechcraft use against
monsters)
[Portrait]Ninja:[Dialog] Dual Wield (allows two weapons to be used at once)
[spazio]It is not possible to assign support abilities that have
the same effect as a unit's inherent job abilities.
[spazio]Monsters cannot be assigned abilities, but some
monsters have inherent reaction abilities like Counter,
or special movement abilities like Fly.{END}

[spazio]Job points (JP) are required to raise a unit's job level
and for a unit to learn new abilities. Job levels are
determined by the total number of job points acquired. To
advance to the next job level, a unit's total number of job
points must reach the amount of points listed under
"Next" in the job status window.


[spazio]Some of a unit's job points are consumed from its
spending pool each time the unit learns a new ability.
However, this does not affect the unit's total number of
job points, which will never decrease.




Job points may be acquired in the following ways:
1. By successfully performing an action in battle.
BIn this case, job points will be acquired for the
Bunit's current job.
2. By having a party member successfully perform
Ban action in battle. The unit will gain points in
Bthe same job as that of the party member.

3. By completing an errand accepted at a tavern.
BJob points will increase for the unit's current job
Bafter he or she has completed the task.{END}

[spazio]Each job has unique abilities to be learned. These
abilities fall into four different categories:
- [Portrait]Action[Dialog]: Abilities performed as actions.
- [Portrait]Reaction[Dialog]: Abilities triggered when attacked.
- [Portrait]Support[Dialog]: Abilities that cause special effects.
- [Portrait]Movement[Dialog]: Abilities that affect a unit's movement
capabilities.{END}

[spazio]Abilities that have been learned must be assigned in
order to be used. This applies to all abilities other than
the unit's job command and any abilities inherent to the
unit's chosen job.




[spazio]A single ability of each of the following types may be
assigned to each unit:
- Job command
- Reaction ability
- Support ability
- Movement ability


[spazio]To assign a new ability to a unit, you must do the
following:
1. Acquire enough job points for the job from which you
Bwish to learn the ability.
2. Spend the acquired job points to learn the ability.
3. Assign the ability to the unit.


[spazio]All of the known action abilities for a particular job
command are assigned to the unit when you assign that
job command to the unit.{END}

[spazio]Reaction abilities are automatically triggered when
the unit is targeted by another unit's action. Examples
include performing a counterattack when attacked, or
automatically using a potion to recover HP after taking
damage. Refer to the help messages for these abilities
to see their specific triggers and effects.{END}

[spazio]A unit's Block Rate (the chance that he or she will
avoid an attack) is determined by the following attributes:

[Portrait]Weapon Power:[Dialog]
[spazio]R/(number): Block Rate for right-hand weapon
[spazio]L/(number): Block Rate for left-hand weapon
[Portrait]C-EV[Dialog]: The unit's inherent chance of evading an attack.

[Portrait]S-EV[Dialog]: The chance a unit will block an attack with the
Tshield it has equipped.
[Portrait]A-EV[Dialog]: The chance an accessory the unit has equipped
Twill block an attack.




[spazio]A weapon's Block Rate only applies when the Parry
ability has been assigned to the wielder, and C-EV, S-
EV, and A-EV are divided into values used against
physical and magickal attacks. Each valid attribute has a
chance to determine if an attack hits. If the attack is
blocked by any of them, it will be successfully evaded.{END}

[spazio]Pressing SELECT when the finger cursor is next to
the name of an ability will display a help message showing
detailed information about the ability. The following is a
list of the terms used in these messages, particularly for
action abilities.



[Portrait]Range:[Dialog] The ability's range. This is an indication of how
many tiles the effect can reach to hit a target. A range
of Self indicates that only the acting unit can be
targeted.
[Portrait]Vert.:[Dialog] Noted in an ability's range or radius, this is the
maximum difference in height (h) that the ability can
reach.

[Portrait]Radius:[Dialog] The radius of the ability's effect. The effect
will reach outward this number of tiles from the target.
If a direction is selected rather than a target, this
indicates how many tiles the effect will reach in that
direction. A radius of 1 means only the target tile is
affected. "Allies" indicates that only allies will be
affected, and "Enemies" indicates that only enemies will
be affected.
[Portrait]MP:[Dialog] The MP cost of casting the magick.
[Portrait]Speed:[Dialog] The Speed attribute of the ability, which affects
the amount of charge time before it takes effect. A
higher speed means the ability can be activated more
quickly.
[Portrait]:[Dialog] This symbol indicates that a magick may be reflected
by the Reflect status effect.

[Portrait]Arithmeticks:[Dialog] Indicates that a magick may be cast with
the Arithmeticks ability.
[Portrait]Effect:[Dialog] Indicates the status effects that may be placed
on the target.
[Portrait]Removes:[Dialog] Indicates the status effects that will be
removed from the target.{END}

[spazio]Pressing SELECT when the finger cursor is next to
the name of an item will display a help message showing
you detailed information about the capabilities of that
particular item. The following is a list of the terms used
in these messages.

[Portrait]Attack:[Dialog] Indicates the attack power of a weapon. A higher

Items can be broken down into the following three groups:[Dialog]
1. Items with effects that are triggered when attacking
or being attacked (weapons, shields, accessories)
2. Items with effects that are triggered when equipped
(armor, accessories)
3. Items with effects that are triggered when used
(consumable items, weapons){END}

[spazio]Monster allies will occasionally lay eggs, even if there
is only one in your party. After enough days have passed,
new monsters will hatch from these eggs. Newly hatched
monsters are the same general type as their parents, but
there is no way of knowing exactly what will emerge until
the egg hatches.


[spazio]Monsters will continue to lay eggs as long as they
remain in your party. Be sure to dismiss any unnecessary
monsters or eggs, or they will quickly fill your party
roster.{END}

[spazio]Taverns are located in cities and castles. At taverns,
you can listen to the latest rumors in order to gain a
better understanding of the events unfolding throughout
the world. You can also learn about various errands, such
as treasure hunting and other odd jobs, and send units to
complete them.


Errands can be completed in the following manner:
[spazio]1. View the description. 
[spazio]2. Accept the task.
LSelect the units to dispatch.
LSelect the number of days to allow those units.
[spazio]3. Pay any necessary fees and dispatch the units.
[spazio]4. Wait for your units to return.
[spazio]5. Return to the tavern to hear their report.
[spazio]When sending units out on a task, it is important to
take their Bravery, Faith, and abilities into
consideration. Depending on the nature of the errand, the
units' jobs may also affect their chances of success.
[spazio]Once the allotted number of days has passed, your units
will return to the same tavern from which they departed
and give a report. After this report, the rewards and job
points obtained by each unit will be shown.
[spazio]Different levels of success may be achieved for each
task. An extremely successful errand can yield results
great enough to be recorded in the Chronicle, such as the
discovery of an ancient wonder or a lost artefact.
Discovering enough of these will earn you honorary titles
as well.{END}

[spazio]In cities and castles, you will find outfitters where
you may buy and sell items. A menu with the following
options will appear when you visit an outfitter:

1. Buy
Purchase items. More goods will become available for
purchase as time goes on.

2. Sell
Sell items in your possession for half their original price.
3. Fitting
Try on equipment in the fitting room before purchasing
it. You may also sell equipped items or items from your
inventory here.
4. Exit
Exit the shop and return to the world map.
[spazio]The following information will be displayed as you
shop:

[Portrait]War Funds[Dialog]
The total amount of gil in your party's possession.
[Portrait]Price[Dialog]
The purchase price of an item when buying, or the sale
price when selling.
[Portrait]Total[Dialog]
The total number of the selected item in your possession,
including those equipped and those in your inventory.
[Portrait]Eqp.[Dialog]
The number of these items currently equipped to units in
your party.


[Portrait]Ledger[Dialog]
Your ledger shows your total funds, the total price of all
items being tried on, and the difference between the two.{END}

[spazio]There is a warriors' guild located in each city and
castle on the world map. At these guilds, you can hire
first-level squires into your employ. It costs nothing to
see the squires who are available, so it may be worth your
while to frequent the guild until you find a recruit to
your liking.
[spazio]Warriors' guilds also allow you to change the names of
any monsters who have joined your party.{END}

[spazio]Poachers' dens will appear in trade towns after a
certain point in your adventure. The tradesmen at these
guilds craft items from slain monsters and sell them to
their members. In order to enter a poachers' den, you
must assign the Poach ability to at least one unit.



[spazio]When a unit with the Poach ability slays a monster,
guild craftsmen will use the remains to create items,
which will then be sold at poachers' dens. Normal items
are sold at half the price they would be at a conventional
outfitter, and there are some items that can only be
purchased at poachers' dens.


[spazio]Since poached monsters are required to create the
items sold at poachers' dens, there is a limit to the
number of items available. The quantity of each item in
stock will be shown as you shop. As you poach more
monsters, the inventory will expand. Which types of
monsters are required to make specific items is a trade
secret.
