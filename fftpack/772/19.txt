 
[spazio]Twilight Gustkov had become the leader of the Wyverns.
In addition to a string of robberies, the outlaw band was
suspected of playing a part in the kidnapping of a member
of the royal family, prompting the Crown to place a
sizeable bounty on Gustkov's head. We bested him after a
lengthy struggle, and were given a generous reward during
a rare public appearance by Celebrant Palcino.{END}

 
[spazio]A rash of monster attacks had finally resulted in the
loss of human life. The behemoth that had taken up
residence in the mountains near Bervenia killed Cassandra,
the owner of a nearby farm, and some thirty others.
Although we were successful in our efforts to slay the
beast, our battle with this king of monsters was
uncomfortably close.{END}

 
[spazio]Bacchus Winery's most popular product is Bacchus
Liqueur, an incredibly sweet drink made from bacchus
seeds, and it was the reason for the attacks on the
company's wains. What was thought to be the work of
bandits was actually that of monsters drawn to the sweet
smell. We defeated them and their leader Lilith, ensuring
that Ivalicians could again partake of Bacchus's blessing.{END}

 
[spazio]Enticed by the offer of reward, we set off to find a
dragon. After a fierce battle in the Glenn Peaks, we
succeeded in slaying one. No sooner had we extracted its
tooth than we found ourselves ringed by soldiers-the
duke's men. Duke McEnroe himself was present, and gave
us a fine reward for the tooth. We felt a tinge of pity
for the duke, who must buy his own son's respect.{END}

 
[spazio]The labyrinthine cave on the outskirts of Warjilis led
to a vast underground lake. We sensed we were being
watched as we stared across the water, and turned to see
a pack of red mousses ready to pounce. After overcoming
our foes, we saw an astonishing sight: the blossom of a
whisperweed, a plant that blooms only once in several
millenia. Could the monsters have been protecting it?{END}

 
[spazio]Typhoon Karzst has been captured! We learned that
Bevester Karzst, wanted for 765 counts of purse-
snatching, was hiding in Sal Ghidos, and quickly set out
to capture him. We were aided by a mysterious ninja clad
in black, who promptly vanished after we defeated the
Typhoon. Witnesses told us that the ninja was none other
than the informant who had sold us the information.{END}

 
[spazio]Count Minimas has been exposed! After defeating the
door mimic, we performed a cursory search of the area,
whereupon we were startled to discover a cache of gold
and documents hidden in the count's cellar. The nature of
the documents would take too long to explain here, but
suffice to say they removed any chance of the count
winning the upcoming mayoral election.{END}

 
[spazio]The cave mimic is an unusual predator whose enormous
mouth resembles that of a cave. Usually found in natural
caverns, this one had taken up residence at the entrance
to the Ural mythril mine. Word among the miners was that
an adamantitan that had once dwelt in the mine had cursed
it, summoning the mimic. Whatever the reason for the
mimic's presence, it was a most unusual task.{END}

 
[spazio]Zerro struck again, targeting Viscount Barfire this
time. Zerro, who seems to target corrupt aristocrats,
infiltrated the noble's manor dressed as a guard. He fled
with paintings, gold, and other treasure. We managed to
corner him in the gardens, but he disappeared in a cloud of
smoke, leaving behind a message and treasure. After
verifying he was gone, we claimed the treasure and left.{END}

 
[spazio]Zerro struck again! This time, his target was Baron
Barthundra, a dealer in art. Unbeknownst to the baron,
Zerro had been hired as an assistant at his gallery,
allowing him to pilfer paintings, gold, and other valuables
undetected. Before disappearing yet again, he left behind
a note and a treasure. After ensuring we were not being
watched, we claimed the treasure and headed for home.{END}

 
[spazio]Zerro returned for another heist, this time targeting
Baron Barfrost. Given Zerro's history, we thought it
best to guard the baron's priceless art collection. Despite
our best preparations, Zerro gained access to the Baron's
estate in the guise of a gardener and escaped with
paintings and gold. Before vanishing into the night, he
left behind a message and a treasure, which we took.{END}

 
[spazio]Zerro struck again, this time against Magister Bardeth.
The city guard did their best to stop him, but Zerro gained
access to the magisterial estate in the guise of a cook,
sneaking past the guards and escaping with priceless
treasures and gold. Though the magister's collection of fine
art is famous, not a single work was stolen. The city guard
was left in confusion.{END}

 
[spazio]At last we know what Zerro was truly after-a golden
Mashmal drachma. This coin, a relic of old Ivalice, was
minted by Focara's late grandfather, and she wished to
return it to her grandfather's grave. Zerro learned this,
and pilfered it in an attempt to woo her. Slipping away,
Zerro was heard to say, "As long as there is injustice,
and as long as there is hope, Zerro will always return!"{END}

 
[spazio]The chimera, once thought extinct, had indeed
reappeared. Such an abomination-a foul creation bearing
the features of countless beasts-could only have been
wrought by the hand of man. It stands to reason that the
chimera was the work of dark sorcery, and rumor would
place responsibility on one of the townspeople. We managed
to fell the beast in a battle that spanned some eight hours.{END}

 
[spazio]We were called to assist in an unusual case of pet-
turned-monster. The metamorphosis resulted from magicks
that the pet's owner, young Diara Luca, had found in an
ancient tome in her family library. After disposing of the
pet and questioning Diara, we learned that the chimera
seen in town not long ago was also hers. We released her
after eliciting a promise that she stop experimenting.{END}

 
[spazio]The Braana clan has been defeated! The pirates had
been plundering small fishing villages on the outskirts of
town, taking hostages from each to keep others from
calling for help. But thanks to the bravery of a ten-year-
old girl named Fia in a tiny fishing village near Riovanes
Castle, we were notified of the pirates' plot, and the
craven lot was brought to justice.{END}

 
[spazio]Lady Vitts, the proprietress of an inn near Zeltennia
Castle, lost her six-year-old son Gallua to an accident.
However, as we discovered during our investigation, she
was convinced he still lived. According to a doctor learned
in such matters, the trauma of losing her son caused the
good lady to lose touch with reality, resulting in this
errand which we were sadly unable to complete.{END}

 
[spazio]Little Cornelia, Baron Catastro's only daughter, was
kidnapped by a man calling himself "Jacques le rapeur" and
demanding the Catastro family jewels. We met the culprit
on the pretense of delivering them. As it turned out,
"Jacques le rapeur" was actually a man by the name of
Roberts-Cornelia's tutor. Cornelia had planned the
kidnapping in an attempt to reunite her estranged parents.{END}

 
[spazio]Duke McEnroe's son was kidnapped by brigands claiming
to work against the nobility. The city guard conducted
their own investigation, supplemented by an outside
search party at the request of the duke. Working with
members of the guard, we infiltrated the culprits'
hideout, and rescued young Pappal. It seems the men's
ultimate goal was the dissolution of Ivalice's aristocracy.{END}

 
[spazio]Carrot, a five-month-old malboro kept as a pet by
Countess Zalmasse, had gone missing. After an extended
search, we found Carrot feeding in the hills behind
Zalmasse Manor and recaptured her. Consulting with a
specialist, we learned that domesticated malboros regress
to their wild state every fourth generation, and
determined this was the cause of little Carrot's escape.{END}

 
[spazio]We headed to an old house on the outskirts of Lesalia to
investigate the cause of mysterious noises. They started
late that night and seemed to be emanating from a room on
the second floor. Upon entering the room, we found a doll
crying alone in the pitch blackness. Later, we learned that
the house's former residents had died in a fire many years
ago. Was the doll lamenting the fate of its owner?{END}

 
[spazio]We looked into the items washing up on the shore near
the city of Gariland. We mostly found refuse from cities
across the sea, but amongst the garbage we saw a small
bottle containing a scrap of paper. Although we were
unable to decipher the foreign script inscribed on the
paper, it appeared to be a plea of some sort.{END}

 
[spazio]We were asked by residents of Goug to defeat a
monster living in an abandoned well. What we found at its
dark, dank bottom was a figure in the shape of a man,
covered from head to toe in mud. It took all of our
strength to defeat it. From its remains crawled a
bedraggled vagrant. It seems that he had taken shelter in
the well, only to be engulfed by the mud monster.{END}

 
[spazio]We followed up on reports of a strange figure seen
prowling the streets of Zeltennia. We soon spied our
quarry, but as we followed him, our surroundings suddenly
seemed unfamiliar. The figure was none other than the
legendary phantom known as the Black Cape, and it had
trapped us within an umbral prison. However, our faith
and bravery allowed us to break free and defeat the shade.{END}

 
[spazio]Our investigation of an abandoned dwelling just within
the outer wall of Limberry Castle revealed arteficers'
tools of varying design and a golem some 4 sectas from
head to toe. The golem attacked, and we destroyed it only
with great difficulty. Not long afterward, the golem's
creator, a man by the name of Master Gell, returned. He
claimed to be experimenting in alchemical reanimation.{END}

 
[spazio]For five days, thirty students of the Riovanes
Military Institute had confined themselves to an ancient
mountain temple outside of town. It seems this was in
protest for beatings received at the hands of their
teachers. The Ivalician Minister of Education has taken
the charges very seriously, and dismissed a number of
faculty members from the school, including the headmaster.{END}

 
[spazio]Our investigation revealed that there was indeed a spy
in the secret society's ranks. Heckern Mauer, a man of
one-and-forty, had been hired by a rival group as a spy.
Through his testimony, we learned the society had been
trafficking in endangered resplendent chocobo plumes. We
searched their base, whereupon one of the smugglers
confessed, helping us take down the entire syndicate.{END}

 
[spazio]Viscount Lachayle entrusted us with a centuries-old
family heirloom, so that we might determine if it was
genuine. Consulting various experts, we obtained proof of
its authenticity. However, the viscount's remark that he
loved it above all else led to the dissolution of his marriage
while we were away. He seemed to learn from the
experience, and gave us the treasure upon our return.{END}

 
[spazio]It seems that the bard Edward is in love with Anna,
the golden voice of Warjilis. Although their work rarely
allows the two to meet, they have exchanged love letters
for years. We discovered this sweet truth upon delivering
the bard's letter.{END}

 
[spazio]Count Minimas, famed for his yearly contributions to
local Dorter charities, could not open his family vault. It
seems that it had been stuffed full with bags of gil,
jamming the opening mechanism. Although this reminded us
of the lavish lifestyles that nobles lead, we felt Count
Minimas and his charity work a shining example in our
corrupt society, and so we were happy to aid him.{END}

 
[spazio]We discovered that the raffleshiva, the legendary man-
eating plant, does indeed exist. It grows in the north, and
its blossoms can reach 5 sectas in diameter. It reached
for us with its giant tentacles when we encountered it,
but somehow we managed to escape. We have no doubt that
the scientific community will be most interested in this
find.{END}

 
[spazio]Anna, the renowned singer, is to be married! After
seven years of long-distance romance, a date is finally set.
The lucky man is none other than Edward, a bard employed
at Riovanes. Edward's gentlemanly manner has caused many
to suspect he may be a prince in disguise-mayhap of
continental royalty. This charm is no doubt what attracted
Anna to him. We wish the two of them every happiness.{END}

 
[spazio]A new star is born! Cattedona Fimm, a young orator of
nine-and-ten, had this to say about coming in first place in
her first speech contest: "Until very recently, I was so
shy I couldn't even talk to other people. But after being
taught the basics of conversation, I'm not afraid
anymore." Cattedona continued with a wide smile, "You
need to face your fears in life!"{END}

 
[spazio]Dorman, a boy of seven who hated math, recently raised
his hand to answer a question in math class during open
house. We were able to witness the miracle for ourselves.
Recalling how the child struggled to answer even the
simplest questions when we began tutoring him, we could
not help but smile, and we swelled with pride as he
correctly answered the difficult question.{END}

 
[spazio]Mameco, a wandering minstrel, has returned to the
stage. Since winning a talent contest several years ago,
his unique act had been the favorite of local audiences.
However, an extended slump had rendered him unable to
perform. We spoke with him at length, and though we are
unsure if our off-the-cuff suggestion for a new hairstyle
made the difference, Mameco seems in better spirits.{END}

 
[spazio]Count Minimas, famed in Dorter for his yearly
donations to the Red Wings, found himself unable to open
the door to his mansion. Newly added solid gold fittings
had rendered the door too heavy to open. But once again,
we couldn't help but think of the philanthropic count as
one of the few hopes for our corrupt society.{END}

 
[spazio]We took part in the annual Clockwork Faire as
assistants to the Goliphans machinists' club. The Goliphans
enter the competition every year and always do admirably,
but had never taken the first prize. But this time, despite
the fact that there were more entrants than ever in the
contest's history, the Goliphans' innovative clockwork
chocobo carriage brought them victory.{END}

 
[spazio]Not long ago, the wandering minstrel Mameco gave his
first performance in nigh on ten years. Although he had
been in an extended slump, he is now an indispensable part
of Eagrose's nightlife, and his farewell show was his most
spectacular yet. Our thoughts were with Mameco as he
departed on his new tour.{END}

 
[spazio]A party was held at Gysahl Greens, an eatery renowned
for its fine chocobo cuisine. What precisely the party was
for we could not say, for we were much too busy working
to ask any questions. We arrived early in the morning and
began preparing food, washed a mountain of dirty dishes,
and finally worked to clean up after the party had finished.
It was dawn before we were done.{END}

 
[spazio]The Blackjack, a casino ship equipped with slot machines
and all manner of card games, docked in Warjilis Bay.
Gambling is strictly regulated by the city, but the owner
of the ship, a man of seven-and-twenty named Setzer,
claims that he was merely trying to bring a little
enjoyment into the drab lives of the townspeople.{END}

 
[spazio]A casino ship, the Blackjack, had arrived in port, and
we paid it a visit. Just as we were told, the slot machine
in the far left corner immediately gave a seven on each
reel-a jackpot! We continued to obtain jackpots, but our
earnings were quite low. When asked, the ship's owner, a
man by the name of Setzer, told us he had reduced the
machine's payout to let people feel like they were winning.{END}

 
[spazio]The president of Larcam Mercantile, Nalman Hosse, a
man aged one-and-forty, is now wanted by the authorities
for drug smuggling. While fighting a monster attacking the
company's caravan, one of the chocobo wains overturned,
revealing a large stash of drugs. We turned the driver over
to the city guard, but their investigation determined that
the president was behind the entire operation.{END}

 
[spazio]We had been asked by Old Blanche to deliver her son
Dinar his favorite dish. Upon learning he was slain by
monsters that morning, we agonized over how to break the
news. On the advice of Dinar's wife, we told her that we
had delivered the meal and Dinar was well. Old Blanche is
blind and has little time left, but her last wish-to make
this dish for her son on his birthday-is now fulfilled.{END}

 
[spazio]The Duchess Cupper's son Michael, a boy of two-and-
ten, received a perfect score on his Gariland Magick Exam.
With a pass rate of 1 in 600, the exam is said to be one
of the most difficult in Ivalice, and Michael is only the
second in history to pass with a perfect score. Given this,
our reward of 10,000 gil seemed rather stingy, but
Michael's smile when he heard the news was reward enough.{END}

 
[spazio]The Yardrow Melee is an event held annually in the
Walled City. This is the 80th year that this contest has
been held, and as such it has grown to become a sizeable
competition. Although we were defeated once in the
qualifying rounds, we were somehow able to advance to the
final tournament, where we defeated Gustaf, a Yardrow
assassin, to claim the title.{END}

 
[spazio]The annual Zaland Melee took place just outside of the
city proper. Champions from all over Ivalice were invited
to take part in the competition, modeled after a similar
event held in Yardrow. Luckily, these entrants were
pitted against one another, allowing us to advance to the
finals with relative ease. In the end, we emerged as the
new champions of the competition.{END}

 
[spazio]A magick melee was held in Gariland. Competitors fought
one another using only magick, allowing mages of all stripes
to demonstrate their skills. We performed admirably, easily
winning the initial rounds and finally besting Alestair, a
black mage from Dorter, to become the 13th champions
in the melee's history.{END}

 
[spazio]The annual Arteficers' Contest was held in the city of
Goug. This contest is meant to test three skills required
of any engineer-knowledge, dexterity, and technical skill,
with the winner being the person with the highest score
among all three categories. Although we lost points in the
